We have two of them, in fact. But if you&rsquo;re a dyed-in-the-wool phone enthusiast, you don&rsquo;t need a guide that&rsquo;s going to give you the best rational recommendation. You need something that&rsquo;s going to help you scratch your new gadget itch in the most satisfying way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m here for you because, well, I&rsquo;m one of you. This is the internet&rsquo;s premiere buying guide for phone enthusiasts. We&rsquo;re not going to focus on practical, rational choices, nor are we going to concern ourselves with budgets. These are the dream phones, the ones you buy not as a utilitarian tool, but for the fun of playing with a new piece of tech that you&rsquo;ll probably sell or trade in for a loss in six months. I&rsquo;m not even going to single out a specific model that you should buy, because you&rsquo;re likely buying a new phone every year (or maybe more!) anyway. This is all about throwing caution to the wind, diving deep into a hobby, and buying something you don&rsquo;t need but absolutely want.

You can&rsquo;t call yourself a Real Phone Enthusiast without one in your life. Hands down, the best folding phone you can buy right now is Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. It&rsquo;s got everything you might want from a modern smartphone, but it also opens up into a tablet-sized screen that lets you put more than one app side-by-side or look at a giant version of Google Maps. It&rsquo;s easy to justify because you can tell yourself that you will get SO MUCH WORK done on it, right after you finish watching that YouTube video. Promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fold 2 costs more than most laptops, you have to baby it, and there&rsquo;s a really good chance the screen will crack or break on you even if you are careful, but that&rsquo;s just the price you have to pay to be on the bleeding edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/?modelCode=SM-F916UZKAATT&amp;nrtv_cid=.nrtv_plchldr.&amp;cid=opmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mob-042720-142014-nymag-6697345&amp;utm_source=nymag&amp;utm_medium=narrativ&amp;utm_campaign=6697345&amp;utm_content=mob\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5K-YVNSviYToCm9Z51e7yJbjww=/0x0:2040x1528/1200x1200/filters:focal(1020x764:1021x765)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21829982/Product_image_15.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/?modelCode=SM-F916UZKAATT&amp;nrtv_cid=.nrtv_plchldr.&amp;cid=opmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mob-042720-142014-nymag-6697345&amp;utm_source=nymag&amp;utm_medium=narrativ&amp;utm_campaign=6697345&amp;utm_content=mob\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY Z FOLD 2</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$1,799</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re buying a folding phone and are willing to pay the cost to get one, you should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold2-5g/buy/?modelCode=SM-F916UZKAATT&amp;nrtv_cid=.nrtv_plchldr.&amp;cid=opmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mob-042720-142014-nymag-6697345&amp;utm_source=nymag&amp;utm_medium=narrativ&amp;utm_campaign=6697345&amp;utm_content=mob\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\">$1,799&nbsp;AT SAMSUNG</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.bestbuy.com/site/-/6426273.p\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\">$1,799&nbsp;AT BEST BUY</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"iPhone 12 mini\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_v6-tWwmYTxx_Tv83wB_WIuYvOs=/0x0:2050x1367/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2050x1367):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22015272/cgartenberg_201105_4276_004.0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Apple iPhone 12 Mini</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APPLE IPHONE 12 MINI</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>THE BEST IPHONE FOR WHEN YOU&rsquo;RE DOUBLE-FISTING AN ANDROID PHONE</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, I know that you know that everyone in the world has an iPhone and it&rsquo;s the farthest thing from an &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; phone.

It can shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s still a phone camera and can&rsquo;t really hold a candle to the image quality or creative control you get with a larger mirrorless camera.

Instead, priced at &euro;599 (about $730), the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. As a side note, final US pricing is TBD &mdash; Asus says somewhere between $599 and $799 &mdash; but it will be coming to North America, unlike last year&rsquo;s model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that&rsquo;s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s an Android iPhone mini, and it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>OUR REVIEW OF<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/products/asus-zenfone-8/9583\">ASUS ZENFONE 8</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>VERGE SCORE8OUT OF 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRWhucyqcsQWrUdGd9sSMk4YSzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499352/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0001sq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GOOD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Thoughtful compact design</li>\r\n	<li>Robust build quality and IP68 rating</li>\r\n	<li>Excellent Snapdragon 888 performance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>BAD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Battery life is just okay</li>\r\n	<li>Only two major OS updates</li>\r\n	<li>No telephoto camera</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZo6_2wj-LRtpeo90l3wL7fgYDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ASUS ZENFONE 8 SCREEN AND DESIGN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>TheThe&nbsp;ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn&rsquo;t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can&rsquo;t find fault with this phone&rsquo;s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone &mdash; swiping, scrolling, animations &mdash; look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display&rsquo;s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can&rsquo;t get it&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>I CAN&rsquo;T GET IT&nbsp;<em>ALL</em>&nbsp;THE WAY INTO A BACK JEANS POCKET, BUT IT MOSTLY FITS</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that&rsquo;s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it&rsquo;s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone&rsquo;s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There&rsquo;s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to&nbsp;<em>me,</em>&nbsp;not something I&rsquo;ve had to adapt to using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BEgC7hZxulpOrJD0OOJ9ag9GPzo=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A smaller phone means a smaller battery.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ASUS ZENFONE 8 BATTERY AND SOFTWARE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>TheThe&nbsp;phone&rsquo;s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity &mdash; 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7&rsquo;s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn&rsquo;t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won&rsquo;t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8&rsquo;s battery, there are plenty of options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide &ldquo;at least&rdquo; two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That&rsquo;s on the low side of what we&rsquo;d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple&rsquo;s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile&rsquo;s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can&rsquo;t use this phone on Verizon, and there&rsquo;s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4YP0oR7_eBpWviD2MTVxO-d2kQo=/0x0:2000x1333/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1333):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ASUS ZENFONE 8 CAMERA</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>ThereThere&nbsp;are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8&rsquo;s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They&rsquo;re borrowed from last year&rsquo;s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8&rsquo;s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn&rsquo;t moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;GRID VIEW</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/raINO8fuI0YrOXayumiFlBn95xo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507623/P_20210509_130526.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 of 20</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it&rsquo;s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there&rsquo;s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel &ldquo;lossless&rdquo; digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn&rsquo;t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can&rsquo;t have everything on such a small device, and I&rsquo;d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHe4SfbPwXz2XvLpY8WAo3EZso4=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The ZenFone 8 doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheThe&nbsp;ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it&rsquo;s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8&rsquo;s small form factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to look to iOS for this phone&rsquo;s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it&rsquo;s likely to be the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you&rsquo;re flexible in your choice of operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>FLAGSHIP-LEVEL BUILD QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE QUITE LITERALLY IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease\">having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini</a>, and if there&rsquo;s one thing Apple is good at, it&rsquo;s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we&rsquo;ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I&rsquo;ve used recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can&rsquo;t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you&rsquo;ll need to look elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You&rsquo;ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photography by Allison Johnson / The Verge</em></p>', 'The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package', 'The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package', 'image (8).jpg', 1, '2021-05-31', 1),

Based on Nvidia&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer\">latest Ampere architecture</a>, the RTX 3080 Ti will succeed the RTX 3080 and promises to deliver 1.5x more performance over the previous generation RTX 2080 Ti. Nvidia is making the RTX 3080 Ti available worldwide on June 3rd, priced from $1,199.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RTX 3080 Ti looks very much like the RTX 3080, with an identical design and ports. The main difference is a jump in power and VRAM. The RTX 3080 Ti ships with more VRAM than the RTX 3080, with 12GB of GDDR6X in total. This new GPU is essentially as close as you can get to an RTX 3090 on paper, with half the VRAM. The $1,199 price matches the same pricing Nvidia used for the RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition cards, and it&rsquo;s $300 less than the giant RTX 3090.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>RTX 3080 TI SPECS</h3>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width:100%\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>&nbsp;</th>\r\n			<th>RTX 3090</th>\r\n			<th>RTX 3080 Ti</th>\r\n			<th>RTX 3080</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tfoot>\r\n		<tr>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tfoot>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>GPU clusters</td>\r\n			<td>82</td>\r\n			<td>80</td>\r\n			<td>68</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>CUDAs</td>\r\n			<td>10496</td>\r\n			<td>10240</td>\r\n			<td>8704</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>RTs</td>\r\n			<td>82</td>\r\n			<td>80</td>\r\n			<td>68</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Tensor</td>\r\n			<td>328</td>\r\n			<td>320</td>\r\n			<td>272</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>ROPs</td>\r\n			<td>112</td>\r\n			<td>112</td>\r\n			<td>96</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Boost clock</td>\r\n			<td>1695MHz</td>\r\n			<td>1665Mhz</td>\r\n			<td>1710Mhz</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Memory</td>\r\n			<td>24GB G6X</td>\r\n			<td>12GB G6X</td>\r\n			<td>10GB G6X</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Bus</td>\r\n			<td>384-bit</td>\r\n			<td>384-bit</td>\r\n			<td>320-bit</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Bandwidth</td>\r\n			<td>936 GB/s</td>\r\n			<td>912 GB/s</td>\r\n			<td>760 GB/s</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>TDP</td>\r\n			<td>350W</td>\r\n			<td>350W</td>\r\n			<td>320W</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Price</td>\r\n			<td>$1,499</td>\r\n			<td>$1,199</td>\r\n			<td>$699</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re obviously losing out on an extra 12GB of VRAM if you opt for the RTX 3080 Ti over the 3090, and what will likely be a small improvement in performance for that $300 difference. But the RTX 3090 is giant because it has a far bigger cooler, and the RTX 3080 Ti has the same hardware design as the RTX 3080.

You&rsquo;ll need a 750-watt power supply, and the card can draw up to 350 watts of power. That&rsquo;s the same as the RTX 3090, but the RTX 3080 draws less at up to 320 watts. Just like the RTX 3080 before it, the 3080 Ti also uses Nvidia&rsquo;s new 12-pin connector.

It will include 8GB of GDDR6X memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both new RTX cards will support all of Nvidia&rsquo;s ray-tracing, DLSS, and Reflex technologies. More than 50 games now support Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), offering AI-powered performance boosts to games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While both of Nvidia&rsquo;s new GPUs will be available this month, actual availability and pricing is obviously going to differ.

But it was Chuck E. Cheese, of all places, that had the foresight and steely clarity to see not just what the new era required, but what it permitted. With much of America suddenly interacting with restaurants through delivery apps, the food industry had been transformed into e-commerce, and the arcade better known for its ball pits than its food was free to invent a new identity: &ldquo;Pasqually&rsquo;s Pizza &amp; Wings.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pasqually&rsquo;s cover was blown a month later, when Kendall Neff of Philadelphia wrote on Reddit that the pizza she ordered from what she believed was a local mom and pop in fact came from Chuck E. Cheese operating under an alias. But the gambit was a success. This March, the company told the trade publication&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodondemandnews.com/03252021/pasquallys-pizza-wont-fade-away-with-the-pandemic/\"><em>Food on Demand</em></a>&nbsp;that Pasqually&rsquo;s is here to stay. And it is far from alone. In fact, during a period when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/over-110-000-restaurants-have-closed-with-sector-in-free-fall\">restaurants closed</a>&nbsp;en masse, restaurant&nbsp;<em>brands</em>&nbsp;proliferated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big chains like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/dennys-launches-2-virtual-brands/593173/\">Denny&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/red-robin-diversifies-with-3-delivery-only-brands/596446/\">Red Robin</a>&nbsp;spawned brands like The Burger Den and The Wing Dept., both announced earlier this year. Meanwhile, a new group of companies is aggressively courting restaurant owners and enlisting them to run delivery-only brands out of their existing businesses. Restaurants can choose from a menu of brands with names like Hot Dog Station, Salad Box, Mr. Cheeseburger, or Grilled Cheese Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551409/4543_PQ_1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>&ldquo;NOW IN MY LITTLE, 1,000-SQUARE-FOOT RESTAURANT, I&rsquo;M NOW CARRYING ABOUT 12, 14 BRANDS&rdquo;</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551408/4543_PQ_2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are called virtual brands, and as with so many pandemic trends, they preceded COVID but were accelerated by it. In the past, restaurants might occasionally use aliases to increase their likelihood of appearing in search results, and Uber Eats has had a program helping restaurants set them up since 2017. But when it came to imagining the future of delivery, most attention and funding focused on the virtual brand&rsquo;s better-known cousin, the ghost kitchen. Startups like Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick&rsquo;s CloudKitchens garnered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-back-travis-kalanicks-new-startup-11573122604\">large investments</a>&nbsp;on the premise that multiple delivery-only restaurants sharing specialized commissary spaces would be efficient enough to thrive in the low-margin world of food delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual brands in some ways represented an opposite bet: that there are already too many restaurants, with too much kitchen capacity sitting idle, and that it can be put to use running delivery-only brands. Then came COVID, and every restaurant abruptly had extra kitchen capacity and a desperate need for revenue. There followed a Cambrian explosion of virtual brands. Uber Eats estimates the number of virtual brands on its platform more than tripled in 2020, to over 10,000. Grubhub reports a similar boom. According to a report the company released this year, 15 percent of restaurants operated a virtual brand before the pandemic. By the end of 2020, 51 percent had at least one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And many have more than one brand. A lot more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now in my little, 1,000-square-foot restaurant, I&rsquo;m now carrying about 12, 14 brands,&rdquo; says Ty Brown, with some astonishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It started gradually. Brown, a 43-year-old entrepreneur living in Brooklyn, had just opened The Bergen, a small takeout spot in his neighborhood, when he got a call from someone in California who said he was with a company called Future Foods. (Future Foods is actually an arm of Kalanick&rsquo;s notoriously secretive ghost kitchen company, as food journalist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/hngry/accidental-ghost-kitchens-pervade-as-restaurants-struggle-to-reopen-1bc46bd46c8c\">Matt Newberg reported</a>&nbsp;in June, though the two do not publicize their connection.) The pitch was simple: Brown was already making burgers and wings at The Bergen, so Future Foods would set him up with some additional brands &mdash; Burger Mansion and Killer Wings &mdash; which the company would list on delivery apps. Whenever someone bought from one of these brands, Brown would fill the orders, and Future Foods would send him a check for the revenue, minus its cut of around 20 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bergen was Brown&rsquo;s first restaurant, though far from his first business. He&rsquo;d long been active in his neighborhood through a variety of ventures, chiefly the Brooklyn United Music &amp; Arts Program, a nonprofit youth center and marching band he founded and runs. The kids in the program were always asking their parents about dinner, he says, so when he noticed the restaurant down the street had closed, he decided to lease it and open a spot of his own. Future Foods seemed like a helpful boost as he got on his feet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also hoped it would give him an edge on the apps that dominate delivery. Like many restaurant owners, his relationship with the apps is one of fraught dependence. He relies on them for orders and to handle delivery, but their fees, plus the advertising he says he must buy in order to get noticed, means he ends up paying them up to 25 percent of his revenue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pay to play,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A bag with a sticker for a fake brand called Wings of Fire next to a basket of chicken wings and a clear plastic cup with another sticker for Wings of Fire on a yellow backdrop.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LJir_v90bojtssEmi-S8Z7buvcA=/0x0:1360x1360/fit-in/1360x1360/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544346/akrales_20210524_4543_0224_sq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their pitches to restaurant owners, virtual brand companies offer to change this dynamic. Some claim to be able to get better rates with the app companies because they negotiate representing hundreds of restaurants rather than just one. They handle advertising and buy it at scale. Often, sales reps hint at arcane knowledge of platform algorithms. (One restaurant owner had been advised to open on a certain day and keep certain hours to win the algorithm&rsquo;s favor.) But at the simplest level, they supply the menus, photos, and brand names: Something Fishy Fish and Chips, Hey Burger, Tendies Chicken Tenders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With the virtual brands thus far, a lot of it really boils down to search optimization,&rdquo; says Melissa Wilson, a principal at the food service consulting company Technomic. Just as the incentives and constraints of Google search or Facebook&rsquo;s News Feed gave rise to certain emergent styles &mdash; the keyword-crammed headline, the clickbait tease &mdash; digital brands are converging on a distinctive form. Because people search for food on delivery apps in much the same way they search for anything else online &mdash; by product type rather than brand &mdash; specific restaurant names like The Bergen, named after the street it&rsquo;s on, or even Denny&rsquo;s and Red Robin, are too opaque.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(In retrospect, even Chuck E. Cheese&rsquo;s Pasqually&rsquo;s feels like a transitional stage on the way to a fully optimized future, one that hasn&rsquo;t lost its vestigial human name. Insisting it never meant to deceive,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodondemandnews.com/03252021/pasquallys-pizza-wont-fade-away-with-the-pandemic/\">the company</a>&nbsp;has pointed out that Pasqually is actually the name of the chef who took in Chuck &mdash; or rather, Charles Entertainment Cheese &mdash; the orphaned mouse who, according to the character&rsquo;s surprisingly developed and unexpectedly tragic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insider.com/chuck-e-cheese-backstory-origin-2017-6\">backstory</a>, throws birthday parties for children to make up for those he never had. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a brand fan of Chuck E.

They share an uncanny familiarity, like the name of a restaurant in an airport food court &mdash; something that you feel like you&rsquo;ve heard of before but can&rsquo;t quite place: Noodle House, Pasta Mania, Chef Burger. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to develop an ear for them. Technomic&rsquo;s Wilson picked out two near her: Craftsman Bowls and Craftsman Burgers, spinoffs of a local steakhouse. I first contacted Brown after scanning Grubhub and spotting Wing Dynasty, a name that is both suspiciously bland and contains the truest tell of all: wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"An image of a basket full of wings over a red and yellow background.

It&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If virtual brands are the response of an industry transformed abruptly into e-commerce, wings are the iPhone charger, the weighted blanket, the product that is profitable, in-demand, and so close to being a pure commodity that just about everyone is trying for a piece of the action. Just as hundreds of brands with arbitrary names like ASLTW and GOSICUKA will pop up on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/style/amazon-trademark-copyright.html\">Amazon</a>&nbsp;to sell identical cables or hair ties made in the same factory, because no one brand dominates and anyone has a shot at winning the algorithmic lottery, wing brands exploded over the last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rishi Nigam, CEO of Franklin Junction, calls it &ldquo;the great chicken wing rush of 2020.&rdquo; His company mostly matches established brands with restaurants that have excess capacity &mdash; in practice, often chains inside chains, like the Canadian seafood company The Captain&rsquo;s Boil, which ran for a time out of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/Meriden/Meriden-News/Ruby-Tuesday-now-a-host-kitchen-for-Captain-s-Boil.html\">Ruby Tuesday</a>&nbsp;&mdash; but it made an exception for wings, launching Wings of New York, a virtual brand from the hotdog company Nathan&rsquo;s Famous, as well as WingDepo, which runs out of Frisch&rsquo;s Big Boy. (With virtual brands, it all gets very complicated very quickly.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April 2020 through February 2021, a period when restaurant visits and orders dropped by about 11 percent, wing sales actually rose by 10 percent, according to David Portalatin, senior vice president food industry advisor at NPD. &ldquo;American restaurants in the United States have served more than a billion servings of wings since the pandemic came along,&rdquo; Portalatin says. The same period saw wing prices surge far beyond their pre-pandemic level. According to USDA data, wing prices in the Northeast were up nearly 50 percent at the end of February 2021 from where they were the year before, and they have continued to climb. There have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/operations/massive-chicken-wing-shortage-brewing\">warnings</a>&nbsp;of wing shortages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wings, like pizza and unlike, say, tacos, handle delivery well, and some of the restaurants that specialize in wings, like Wingstop, were already adept at digital ordering and particularly well-suited for the pandemic, Kaiser says. Wings are also extremely simple to make. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a one-ingredient menu, right?&rdquo; says Nigam. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no barrier to entry. You and I could launch a wing brand by 6PM tonight.&rdquo; Crucially, no one brand dominated the category, and there is no proprietary wing type or sauce, so any given restaurant&rsquo;s overnight wing brand had a decent chance of winning attention on the delivery apps. This made wings an obvious first target for restaurants that had idle kitchens and needed additional revenue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It all added up to a perfect storm,&rdquo; says Portalatin, &ldquo;for wings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551409/4543_PQ_1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>&ldquo;I HAD TO GO OPEN UP A CREDIT ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO JUST CARRY ENOUGH WINGS.

Then COVID hit and his walk-in business evaporated. People were ordering dinner more than lunch, Rubin observed, and were particularly interested in &ldquo;craveable&rdquo; comfort foods, and there were only a few good wing brands in New York City, so he launched Wing Shop. &ldquo;We got lucky with that one,&rdquo; he says, being among the early entrants to the great wings rush. Now &ldquo;everyone and their mother is launching a wing concept.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big chains like Applebee&rsquo;s jumped in, first with the brand Neighborhood Wings, then with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/applebee-s-owner-says-it-found-formula-to-stand-out-on-ubereats\">Cosmic Wings</a>, an attempt to establish a proprietary moat through exclusive Cheetos dust.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/help-virtual-brand-chilis-sees-near-normal-sales-january\">Chili&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;launched It&rsquo;s just Wings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.qsrmagazine.com/emerging-concepts/smokey-bones-virtual-wing-brand-races\">Smokey Bones</a>&nbsp;barbecue chain launched The Wing Experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, virtual franchises started hitting up independent operators and pushing them to take on additional wing brands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was crazy with wings,&rdquo; says Dawn Skeete, the owner of Jam&rsquo;it Bistro. She opened her Jamaican restaurant in south Brooklyn in 2019, and when the pandemic hit, Future Foods seemed like an appealing way to test what items at what prices sold in her neighborhood. The barbecue brand, OMG BBQ LOL, didn&rsquo;t work out, but she kept going with Just Wing It. Then she took on a second wing brand, Wing Spot, after a new virtual franchise company called Acelerate.io approached her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A bag with a sticker for a fake brand called Devilish Wings next to a basket of chicken wings and a clear plastic cup with another sticker for Devilish Wings on an orange backdrop.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cumVwKrol037lY5UenP6p8ALCts=/0x0:1360x1360/fit-in/1360x1360/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544344/akrales_20210524_4543_0170_drips_sq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acelerate.io is an LA-based company founded by a former DoorDash employee named George Jacobs, who felt that for delivery to be profitable, kitchens had to increase &ldquo;throughput&rdquo; by operating multiple restaurants. The company launched in late 2019 &mdash; with a wing brand, naturally &mdash; and now runs seven brands in &ldquo;several hundred&rdquo; restaurants across the US. (It&rsquo;s spelled &ldquo;Acelerate&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;more efficient with just one c,&rdquo; Jacobs says, but also because &ldquo;accelerate.com&rdquo; was too expensive.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just Wing It and Wing Spot have the same menu, Skeete says, which helped with bulk purchases as wings got more expensive. &ldquo;Wing prices are going through the roof, and I think it has to do with all these virtual kitchens that are doing wings,&rdquo; she says. She&rsquo;s now looking to take on a third wing brand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown always made wings at The Bergen, both under his own name and Future Foods&rsquo; Killer Wings. Business was good for much of 2020. The Bergen&rsquo;s takeout and delivery-focused business was well-positioned for the spring lockdowns. It got publicity for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pix11.com/news/local-news/brooklyn/brooklyn-restaurant-the-bergen-offering-free-meals-amid-covid-19-crisis/\">donating meals</a>&nbsp;to families in need, followed by more attention as a local Black-owned establishment during the protests surrounding George Floyd&rsquo;s murder. The pace was almost more than staff could handle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by the end of the year, business was flagging, so in January, Brown responded to a pitch from Nextbite, an arm of the restaurant software company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodondemandnews.com/11112020/alex-canter-talks-ordermark-and-nextbites-120m-war-chest/\">Ordermark</a>. The company recently received a $120 million investment from SoftBank and has been expanding aggressively, offering restaurant owners, which it calls &ldquo;fulfillment partners,&rdquo; a selection of &ldquo;turnkey&rdquo; virtual brands from which to choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nextbite, man, the day I opened up that brand, they put out a lot of wings,&rdquo; says Brown. &ldquo;I had to go shop for more wings. I had to go open up a credit account in order to just carry enough wings. I had to go buy more freezers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new brands were doing better on the apps than The Bergen, a fact Brown attributes to their ability to game their algorithms. &ldquo;I call it the wizard behind the curtain,&rdquo; he says. If a brand&rsquo;s sales are low, he&rsquo;ll call his support person at its parent company and ask them what&rsquo;s g</p>', 'THE GREAT WINGS RUSH', 'THE GREAT WINGS RUSH', '1622704609_360_F_259782337_99LGtwtE6GODKQI2F0jZZAzOdae5N2KN.jpg', 1, '2021-06-03', 1),

Yet the change did not extend to Google&rsquo;s third-party contractors. &ldquo;Contracting companies, like G4S, are allowed to make rules for their employees that directly contradict [Google&rsquo;s] commitment to inclusion,&rdquo; Lee explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee says that when he arrived at the data center, he was the only transgender security officer on site. In an attempt to connect with other LGBTQ individuals, he tried to join one of Google&rsquo;s employee resource groups, which are designed for underrepresented communities. He says G4S management told him these groups were a &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; to which contractors were not entitled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the Alphabet Workers Union is circulating a petition asking Google and G4S to adopt a chosen name policy for TVCs and full-time staff. The policy should ensure &ldquo;publicly displayed names reflect a chosen name where it differs from their legal name; allows pronoun stickers to be displayed on name badges, and protects the right to privacy of dead names,&rdquo; according to the letter. The union also wants Google and G4S to allow contractors to participate in employee resource groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The petition currently has 165 signatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither Google nor G4S responded to a request for comment from&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>NEXT UP IN&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy\">POLICY</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>', 'The move comes after a transgender man asked to have his deadname removed from his badge and was denied', 'The move comes after a transgender man asked to have his deadname removed from his badge and was denied', '1622712593_image (7).jpg', 0, '2021-06-03', 1),

Snapdragon 888 processor? Check. Fast refresh rate screen? Check. A metric ton of rear-facing cameras? Check, check, check, and check. It&rsquo;s also priced well, starting at $749 while many of its competitors start around the $1,000 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axon 30 Ultra delivers on many fronts, like its high-quality screen and flagship-level performance. For some, that will be enough. However, it falls short in more subtle ways that you won&rsquo;t see on a spec sheet. Its novel camera array is let down by uneven, heavy-handed processing. There&rsquo;s also a stray bug here and there, which can range from harmless (a 5G on / off toggle appears twice in a quick settings menu) to more annoying (the camera shutter noise going off even in silent mode). ZTE may iron out these bugs in future updates, or they won&rsquo;t, and you&rsquo;ll be the obnoxious parent with the noisy smartphone camera during your child&rsquo;s dance recital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>THE AXON 30 ULTRA OFFERS TOP-NOTCH PERFORMANCE WITH A LARGE, LOVELY SCREEN</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And even though all of the key hardware is there, a few flagship-y features have been omitted to hit the Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s more aggressive price point. There&rsquo;s no IP rating for water resistance and no wireless charging. The phone doesn&rsquo;t work on Verizon either, just on T-Mobile and AT&amp;T, and 5G service on T-Mobile is limited to one band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If those factors aren&rsquo;t dealbreakers and you&rsquo;re comfortable working around the occasional quirk, then the Axon 30 Ultra offers top-notch performance with a large, lovely screen at a lower price than the competition. We don&rsquo;t see too many of those high-performance / lower cost premium phones in the US to challenge the heavyweights of the Android world, and it&rsquo;s nice to have an alternative.

It&rsquo;s a 1080p OLED with a refresh rate up to 144Hz. You can set it manually to 60, 90, 120, or 144Hz, or let it switch automatically between those rates based on the content you&rsquo;re viewing. That 144Hz rate is a little faster than the 120Hz rate you&rsquo;ll find on most high-end devices, but I&rsquo;m not sure I could tell the difference between them if I didn&rsquo;t know which was which. The bottom line is that every swipe, scroll, and animation looks incredibly smooth on the 30 Ultra&rsquo;s screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, it&rsquo;s just a really nice screen. Contrast is rich, the bezels are slim, and the panel curves over the sides of the phone; marketers love to call a screen like this &ldquo;immersive,&rdquo; but that actually feels like a fair descriptor. It&rsquo;s a little tough to see outside in bright light, but it&rsquo;s still usable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That big screen makes the Axon 30 Ultra a big device. It&rsquo;s comfortable enough to hold, and the curved screen and back panel help, but I definitely can&rsquo;t reach my thumb clear across the screen while using it one-handed. There&rsquo;s Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panels and the frame is aluminum, giving the whole phone a solid, premium feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ah5AViejfr7YFlSZM3ZX7PQfE7o=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541698/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0003.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Axon 30 Ultra offers Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panel.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone performance also meets the &ldquo;premium&rdquo; bar, thanks to that Snapdragon 888 processor. It feels very snappy jumping between apps, pinching and zooming around Google Maps, and scrolling through Twitter. I&rsquo;m also happy to report that the in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive, too &mdash; it gave me a little thrill with every unlock and password manager authentication. It&rsquo;s a feature that goes the extra distance to making this feel like a highly responsive, premium device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s 4,600mAh battery is big enough and consistently got me through a day of moderate use. However, I was conservative with some battery-draining settings like screen refresh rate, and all of my use was on Wi-Fi, so I expect you could fully drain the battery over the course of a day if you really went for it. Wireless charging is, as mentioned earlier, not an option here, but the phone supports 65W wired charging with the included charging brick, and it is plenty fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Android 11 comes preloaded on the Axon 30 Ultra, and ZTE says an Android 12 update will come at the end of the year or in early 2022. The company doesn&rsquo;t give a firm timeline for security updates but says it generally provides them for around three years. Not the worst support policy by far, but not among the very best. ZTE&rsquo;s Android interface is called MyOS, and it&rsquo;s a straightforward affair that doesn&rsquo;t try to get too fancy. There are a truly overwhelming number of shortcuts in the fully expanded quick settings menu accessed by swiping from the top of the screen, but you can rearrange and whittle them down to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1J9uh8feknRJuWxN9icDcJqL210=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541697/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0002.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cameras galore.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ZTE AXON 30 ULTRA CAMERAS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>RatherRather&nbsp;than one high-resolution main camera complemented by several lower-resolution sensors, ZTE has chosen to put three 64-megapixel sensors in the Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s rear camera array. You&rsquo;ll find a standard wide-angle main camera with optical stabilization, a 35mm-equivalent wide-angle for portraits, and an ultrawide. There&rsquo;s also an 8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera with optical stabilization. It&rsquo;s a lot of cameras, and none of them are throwaways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s cameras are impressive, but they&rsquo;re also a little frustrating. First, the good: these three 64-megapixel cameras all capture a lot of detail in good light, which I&rsquo;d expect from the main camera, but that isn&rsquo;t always the case with ultrawides since they tend to have lower resolution chips. The telephoto module offers 5x true optical zoom &mdash; results aren&rsquo;t great indoors or in dim light, but with plenty of available light, it&rsquo;s much better than the digital zoom alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also really like the portrait lens, which is wider than the telephoto options most other smartphone cameras use. This is a personal preference; I like getting more of the scene in portrait photos, you may not. There&rsquo;s no option to digitally zoom in while using portrait mode if you don&rsquo;t like the wide-angle look, and portrait mode photos (with artificially blurred backgrounds) can only be taken with the dedicated portrait lens or the selfie camera. Something to consider if wide portraits are really not your thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;GRID VIEW</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wofBC3OOZAa850e4jCDgF7l3YBs=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546276/IMG_20210522_051947.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 of 12</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the bad: image processing (particularly color and saturation) is inconsistent between cameras, and two photos from the same camera can vary noticeably with slight shifts in composition or subject positioning. Images from the main camera often look oversaturated. Most of the time it&rsquo;s subtle enough not to bother me much, but then I&rsquo;ll take a picture of my orange cat and he&rsquo;ll look like a Cheeto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portrait mode photos suffer some misses, too: subject separation from blurred backgrounds can look a little clumsy, and the lack of OIS in the portrait camera means you&rsquo;re more likely to see slight blur in dimmer conditions, even without much camera movement. The wider focal length also means you&rsquo;ll need to crank up the blur if you want to obscure a distracting background, which makes the subject cut-out problems more obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>WHEN THE AXON 30 ULTRA DOES GET THINGS RIGHT, IMAGES LOOK REALLY GOOD</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe these shortcomings are more frustrating because when the Axon 30 Ultra does get things right, images look really good. Exposure is well balanced, all four cameras are genuinely useful, and each of them offers an impressive level of detail retention. I&rsquo;d entertain leaving my dedicated camera at home more often with this combination of focal lengths and capabilities, but image processing is too much of a wild card for me to feel comfortable with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s most annoying bugs lives in the camera app, too: the camera shutter sound is permanently stuck on, even with every volume control set to silent. There&rsquo;s no way to turn it off in the camera settings menu or the main settings menu. I hate this. Maybe some people could live with it. Maybe you can root your phone and eliminate the problem yourself. Maybe ZTE will fix the issue soon. All I know is that I cannot live a shutter-sound-on lifestyle and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing I might return a phone over, no matter how good the pictures look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbiJmk7KSBe3lZqJX6LZdnKHF_c=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541700/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0005.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Axon 30 Ultra is missing a few flagship-y features like wireless charging, but it doesn&rsquo;t skimp on build quality.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheThe&nbsp;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra is exactly what it appears to be: a lower cost alternative to the big Android flagships with top-tier performance and a great screen. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it to just anyone, and you need to be comfortable either living with a couple of quirks or navigating a way around them. You don&rsquo;t quite get the same level of polish or reassurance that you would from a Samsung, OnePlus, or Google device, but in return you get excellent performance for the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axon 30 Ultra has a healthy price advantage over the other big-screen-big-performance competition like the $1,069 OnePlus 9 Pro and the $999 Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. If you&rsquo;re willing to concede some screen real estate, then its advantage narrows compared to the OnePlus 9 ($729) and standard Galaxy S21 ($800). With either of those options, you&rsquo;ll get the same excellent performance and a few other benefits, like wireless charging and more sophisticated image processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>THE AXON 30 ULTRA HAS A HEALTHY PRICE ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER BIG-SCREEN-BIG-PERFORMANCE COMPETITION</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s an important caveat that the Axon 30 Ultra doesn&rsquo;t work on Verizon. That will rule out a significant number of prospective customers in the US. And I wish the cameras lived up to their hardware potential more often. If that&rsquo;s not much of a concern, you&rsquo;re not a Verizon customer, and your priorities are set on a big screen and snappy day-to-day performance, then you have a great option in the 30 Ultra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that said, I can&rsquo;t see a reason not to buy the Axon 30 Ultra if none of the above concerns you. You&rsquo;ll get excellent performance, a massive screen with a silky smooth fast refresh rate, and great camera hardware &mdash; and you can rub it in your friends&rsquo; faces when you pay several hundred dollars less for your phone than they did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photography by Allison Johnson / The Verge</em></p>', 'If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.

Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>THE IPHONE 12 BALANCES A BIG SCREEN WITH MANAGEABLE SIZE WELL</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery &mdash; two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it&rsquo;s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn&rsquo;t so big that it&rsquo;s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that&rsquo;s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that&rsquo;s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12&rsquo;s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you&rsquo;d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 12 has Apple&rsquo;s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it&rsquo;s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhkcO4raREzH4chnbejAaD_6XNc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248903/vpavic_210119_4377_0153.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 ULTRA</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>BEST ANDROID PHONE TO BUY IN 2021</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it&rsquo;s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it&rsquo;s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can&rsquo;t say we like Samsung&rsquo;s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it&rsquo;s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it&rsquo;s worth looking around for a deal before buying.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mzp2-knGrJWeYI-RWfCFB2tPre4=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258914/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 / S21 PLUS</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>BEST ANDROID PHONE TO FIND A DEAL FOR</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don&rsquo;t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We&rsquo;ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it&rsquo;s a minor refresh over last year&rsquo;s Galaxy S20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1614285-REG/samsung_sm_g991uzaexaa_s21_256gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone&amp;xcust=___vg__p_21927852__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVGteL82Bmw244OrtU6VSeOB8PM=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x1200/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258907/vpavic_210118_4378_0197.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1614285-REG/samsung_sm_g991uzaexaa_s21_256gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone&amp;xcust=___vg__p_21927852__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 (256GB, UNLOCKED)</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$800</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>$850</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>6% off</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most affordable model in the S21 line has a 6.2-inch 1080p screen and refresh rates up to 120Hz.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1614285-REG/samsung_sm_g991uzaexaa_s21_256gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone&amp;xcust=___vg__p_21927852__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$800&nbsp;AT B&amp;H PHOTO</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?ots=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]21927852[t]w[r]theverge.com/phone-review[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xb4HmtRdNY9RjmvGUf2n1_UhZGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x1200/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232920/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0005.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?ots=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]21927852[t]w[r]theverge.com/phone-review[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 PLUS (128GB, UNLOCKED)</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$1,000</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galaxy S21 Plus includes a 6.7-inch 1080p screen with storage configurations of 128GB and 256GB.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?ots=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]21927852[t]w[r]theverge.com/phone-review[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000&nbsp;AT AMAZON</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1614292-REG/samsung_sm_g996uzkaxaa_s21_128gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;xcust=___vg__p_21927852__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000&nbsp;AT B&amp;H PHOTO</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/buy/galaxy-s21-plus-5g-128gb-unlocked-sm-g996uzkaxaa/?nrtv_cid=.nrtv_plchldr.&amp;cid=opmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mob-042720-142014-nymag-6685905&amp;utm_source=nymag&amp;utm_medium=narrativ&amp;utm_campaign=6685905&amp;utm_content=mob\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000&nbsp;AT SAMSUNG</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVPwPyECmoRej8Ys1x-O9IJjKEU=/0x0:2050x1367/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2050x1367):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022582/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APPLE IPHONE 12 PRO MAX</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>BEST PHONE FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO IN 2021</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras &mdash; standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto &mdash; combine with Apple&rsquo;s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn&rsquo;t the best iPhone for most people. It&rsquo;s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12-pro&amp;sharedid=VergeBestPhoneRightNow051321\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hM7iHM_6O-JbYPbZs09RjhcgD3U=/0x0:2050x1367/1200x1200/filters:focal(1025x684:1026x685)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022572/bfarsace_201106_4269_012.0.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12-pro&amp;sharedid=VergeBestPhoneRightNow051321\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APPLE IPHONE 12 PRO MAX</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$1,099</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s top-of-the-line iPhone 12 Pro Max has a better camera system than you can get in the other iPhone models this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12-pro&amp;sharedid=VergeBestPhoneRightNow051321\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,099&nbsp;AT APPLE</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/iphone/iphone-12-pro-max-shop-by-carrier/pcmcat1602690040950.c\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\">$1,099&nbsp;AT BEST BUY</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"iPhone 12 mini\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_v6-tWwmYTxx_Tv83wB_WIuYvOs=/0x0:2050x1367/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2050x1367):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22015272/cgartenberg_201105_4276_004.0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APPLE IPHONE 12 MINI</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>BEST SMALL SMARTPHONE IN 2021</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it&rsquo;s an important one: if you want a phone that&rsquo;s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don&rsquo;t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it&rsquo;s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini&rsquo;s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you&rsquo;re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it&rsquo;s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won&rsquo;t need a PopSocket on this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It&rsquo;s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you prefer Android, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asus Zenfone 8</a>&nbsp;is a good alternative. It&rsquo;s a little bigger than the 12 mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn&rsquo;t work on Verizon, but it&rsquo;s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1032524/7613?sharedid=VergeBestPhonetoBuy04192021&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJjR0RcS1zH-ANNyeeRcX3XMzM4=/0x0:2050x1367/1200x1200/filters:focal(1025x684:1026x685)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22015271/cgartenberg_201105_4276_005.0.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1032524/7613?sharedid=VergeBestPhonetoBuy04192021&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APPLE IPHONE 12 MINI</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$699</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 12 Mini is the smallest phone in Apple&rsquo;s lineup and the best small phone you can get.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1032524/7613?sharedid=VergeBestPhonetoBuy04192021&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$699&nbsp;AT APPLE</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/iphone/iphone-12-mini-shop-by-carrier/pcmcat1602690175713.c\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\">$699&nbsp;AT BEST BUY</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fswxTjsimE7iN0xCynKVtVaIWTw=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21765222/vpavic_200807_4133_0116.0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has the battery life you need to go all day long.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 20 ULTRA</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>IF YOU WANT A STYLUS BUILT INTO YOUR PHONE</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung&rsquo;s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung&rsquo;s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn&rsquo;t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra.

Based on Nvidia&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer\">latest Ampere architecture</a>, the RTX 3080 Ti will succeed the RTX 3080 and promises to deliver 1.5x more performance over the previous generation RTX 2080 Ti. Nvidia is making the RTX 3080 Ti available worldwide on June 3rd, priced from $1,199.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RTX 3080 Ti looks very much like the RTX 3080, with an identical design and ports. The main difference is a jump in power and VRAM. The RTX 3080 Ti ships with more VRAM than the RTX 3080, with 12GB of GDDR6X in total. This new GPU is essentially as close as you can get to an RTX 3090 on paper, with half the VRAM.

You&rsquo;ll need a 750-watt power supply, and the card can draw up to 350 watts of power. That&rsquo;s the same as the RTX 3090, but the RTX 3080 draws less at up to 320 watts.

(379, 20, '2021-06-02 17:16:49', 'THE GREAT WINGS RUSH', 'the-great-wings-rush', '<p><strong>IT WAS MARCH 2020,</strong>&nbsp;and restaurants across the country were shutting down, setting up takeout windows, or doing whatever they could to absorb the shock of COVID. But it was Chuck E. Cheese, of all places, that had the foresight and steely clarity to see not just what the new era required, but what it permitted. With much of America suddenly interacting with restaurants through delivery apps, the food industry had been transformed into e-commerce, and the arcade better known for its ball pits than its food was free to invent a new identity: &ldquo;Pasqually&rsquo;s Pizza &amp; Wings.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pasqually&rsquo;s cover was blown a month later, when Kendall Neff of Philadelphia wrote on Reddit that the pizza she ordered from what she believed was a local mom and pop in fact came from Chuck E. Cheese operating under an alias. But the gambit was a success. This March, the company told the trade publication&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodondemandnews.com/03252021/pasquallys-pizza-wont-fade-away-with-the-pandemic/\"><em>Food on Demand</em></a>&nbsp;that Pasqually&rsquo;s is here to stay. And it is far from alone. In fact, during a period when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/over-110-000-restaurants-have-closed-with-sector-in-free-fall\">restaurants closed</a>&nbsp;en masse, restaurant&nbsp;<em>brands</em>&nbsp;proliferated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big chains like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/dennys-launches-2-virtual-brands/593173/\">Denny&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/red-robin-diversifies-with-3-delivery-only-brands/596446/\">Red Robin</a>&nbsp;spawned brands like The Burger Den and The Wing Dept., both announced earlier this year. Meanwhile, a new group of companies is aggressively courting restaurant owners and enlisting them to run delivery-only brands out of their existing businesses. Restaurants can choose from a menu of brands with names like Hot Dog Station, Salad Box, Mr. Cheeseburger, or Grilled Cheese Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551409/4543_PQ_1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>&ldquo;NOW IN MY LITTLE, 1,000-SQUARE-FOOT RESTAURANT, I&rsquo;M NOW CARRYING ABOUT 12, 14 BRANDS&rdquo;</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551408/4543_PQ_2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are called virtual brands, and as with so many pandemic trends, they preceded COVID but were accelerated by it. In the past, restaurants might occasionally use aliases to increase their likelihood of appearing in search results, and Uber Eats has had a program helping restaurants set them up since 2017. But when it came to imagining the future of delivery, most attention and funding focused on the virtual brand&rsquo;s better-known cousin, the ghost kitchen. Startups like Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick&rsquo;s CloudKitchens garnered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-back-travis-kalanicks-new-startup-11573122604\">large investments</a>&nbsp;on the premise that multiple delivery-only restaurants sharing specialized commissary spaces would be efficient enough to thrive in the low-margin world of food delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual brands in some ways represented an opposite bet: that there are already too many restaurants, with too much kitchen capacity sitting idle, and that it can be put to use running delivery-only brands. Then came COVID, and every restaurant abruptly had extra kitchen capacity and a desperate need for revenue. There followed a Cambrian explosion of virtual brands. Uber Eats estimates the number of virtual brands on its platform more than tripled in 2020, to over 10,000. Grubhub reports a similar boom. According to a report the company released this year, 15 percent of restaurants operated a virtual brand before the pandemic. By the end of 2020, 51 percent had at least one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And many have more than one brand. A lot more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now in my little, 1,000-square-foot restaurant, I&rsquo;m now carrying about 12, 14 brands,&rdquo; says Ty Brown, with some astonishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It started gradually. Brown, a 43-year-old entrepreneur living in Brooklyn, had just opened The Bergen, a small takeout spot in his neighborhood, when he got a call from someone in California who said he was with a company called Future Foods. (Future Foods is actually an arm of Kalanick&rsquo;s notoriously secretive ghost kitchen company, as food journalist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/hngry/accidental-ghost-kitchens-pervade-as-restaurants-struggle-to-reopen-1bc46bd46c8c\">Matt Newberg reported</a>&nbsp;in June, though the two do not publicize their connection.) The pitch was simple: Brown was already making burgers and wings at The Bergen, so Future Foods would set him up with some additional brands &mdash; Burger Mansion and Killer Wings &mdash; which the company would list on delivery apps. Whenever someone bought from one of these brands, Brown would fill the orders, and Future Foods would send him a check for the revenue, minus its cut of around 20 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bergen was Brown&rsquo;s first restaurant, though far from his first business. He&rsquo;d long been active in his neighborhood through a variety of ventures, chiefly the Brooklyn United Music &amp; Arts Program, a nonprofit youth center and marching band he founded and runs. The kids in the program were always asking their parents about dinner, he says, so when he noticed the restaurant down the street had closed, he decided to lease it and open a spot of his own. Future Foods seemed like a helpful boost as he got on his feet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also hoped it would give him an edge on the apps that dominate delivery. Like many restaurant owners, his relationship with the apps is one of fraught dependence. He relies on them for orders and to handle delivery, but their fees, plus the advertising he says he must buy in order to get noticed, means he ends up paying them up to 25 percent of his revenue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pay to play,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A bag with a sticker for a fake brand called Wings of Fire next to a basket of chicken wings and a clear plastic cup with another sticker for Wings of Fire on a yellow backdrop.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LJir_v90bojtssEmi-S8Z7buvcA=/0x0:1360x1360/fit-in/1360x1360/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544346/akrales_20210524_4543_0224_sq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their pitches to restaurant owners, virtual brand companies offer to change this dynamic. Some claim to be able to get better rates with the app companies because they negotiate representing hundreds of restaurants rather than just one. They handle advertising and buy it at scale. Often, sales reps hint at arcane knowledge of platform algorithms. (One restaurant owner had been advised to open on a certain day and keep certain hours to win the algorithm&rsquo;s favor.) But at the simplest level, they supply the menus, photos, and brand names: Something Fishy Fish and Chips, Hey Burger, Tendies Chicken Tenders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With the virtual brands thus far, a lot of it really boils down to search optimization,&rdquo; says Melissa Wilson, a principal at the food service consulting company Technomic. Just as the incentives and constraints of Google search or Facebook&rsquo;s News Feed gave rise to certain emergent styles &mdash; the keyword-crammed headline, the clickbait tease &mdash; digital brands are converging on a distinctive form. Because people search for food on delivery apps in much the same way they search for anything else online &mdash; by product type rather than brand &mdash; specific restaurant names like The Bergen, named after the street it&rsquo;s on, or even Denny&rsquo;s and Red Robin, are too opaque.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(In retrospect, even Chuck E. Cheese&rsquo;s Pasqually&rsquo;s feels like a transitional stage on the way to a fully optimized future, one that hasn&rsquo;t lost its vestigial human name. Insisting it never meant to deceive,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodondemandnews.com/03252021/pasquallys-pizza-wont-fade-away-with-the-pandemic/\">the company</a>&nbsp;has pointed out that Pasqually is actually the name of the chef who took in Chuck &mdash; or rather, Charles Entertainment Cheese &mdash; the orphaned mouse who, according to the character&rsquo;s surprisingly developed and unexpectedly tragic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insider.com/chuck-e-cheese-backstory-origin-2017-6\">backstory</a>, throws birthday parties for children to make up for those he never had. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a brand fan of Chuck E. Cheese, you know who Pasqually is,&rdquo; an executive assured the trade publication&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.qsrmagazine.com/fast-food/chuck-e-cheese-serious-about-pasquallys-pizza-wings?utm_campaign=20200713&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=jolt\"><em>QSR</em></a>. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re curious to know what Pasqually&rsquo;s might taste like.&rdquo;)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newer virtual brands are, paradoxically, distinctively generic. They share an uncanny familiarity, like the name of a restaurant in an airport food court &mdash; something that you feel like you&rsquo;ve heard of before but can&rsquo;t quite place: Noodle House, Pasta Mania, Chef Burger. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to develop an ear for them. Technomic&rsquo;s Wilson picked out two near her: Craftsman Bowls and Craftsman Burgers, spinoffs of a local steakhouse. I first contacted Brown after scanning Grubhub and spotting Wing Dynasty, a name that is both suspiciously bland and contains the truest tell of all: wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"An image of a basket full of wings over a red and yellow background. Several wings have a toothpick planted in them connected to a flag with a different made up chicken wing restaurant logo.  \" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BNEL6abe9m2Fon2lVO1ju1kKK50=/0x0:2040x1360/fit-in/2040x1360/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544350/Wings_Logos.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;OH MY GOD,&nbsp;</strong>I&rsquo;m so sick of talking about chicken wings!&rdquo; exclaims&nbsp;<em>Food on Demand</em>&rsquo;s editor Tom Kaiser, laughing in a way that makes clear he is actually not. &ldquo;How many wings are people eating in a given week? It&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If virtual brands are the response of an industry transformed abruptly into e-commerce, wings are the iPhone charger, the weighted blanket, the product that is profitable, in-demand, and so close to being a pure commodity that just about everyone is trying for a piece of the action. Just as hundreds of brands with arbitrary names like ASLTW and GOSICUKA will pop up on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/style/amazon-trademark-copyright.html\">Amazon</a>&nbsp;to sell identical cables or hair ties made in the same factory, because no one brand dominates and anyone has a shot at winning the algorithmic lottery, wing brands exploded over the last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rishi Nigam, CEO of Franklin Junction, calls it &ldquo;the great chicken wing rush of 2020.&rdquo; His company mostly matches established brands with restaurants that have excess capacity &mdash; in practice, often chains inside chains, like the Canadian seafood company The Captain&rsquo;s Boil, which ran for a time out of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/Meriden/Meriden-News/Ruby-Tuesday-now-a-host-kitchen-for-Captain-s-Boil.html\">Ruby Tuesday</a>&nbsp;&mdash; but it made an exception for wings, launching Wings of New York, a virtual brand from the hotdog company Nathan&rsquo;s Famous, as well as WingDepo, which runs out of Frisch&rsquo;s Big Boy. (With virtual brands, it all gets very complicated very quickly.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April 2020 through February 2021, a period when restaurant visits and orders dropped by about 11 percent, wing sales actually rose by 10 percent, according to David Portalatin, senior vice president food industry advisor at NPD. &ldquo;American restaurants in the United States have served more than a billion servings of wings since the pandemic came along,&rdquo; Portalatin says. The same period saw wing prices surge far beyond their pre-pandemic level. According to USDA data, wing prices in the Northeast were up nearly 50 percent at the end of February 2021 from where they were the year before, and they have continued to climb. There have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/operations/massive-chicken-wing-shortage-brewing\">warnings</a>&nbsp;of wing shortages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wings, like pizza and unlike, say, tacos, handle delivery well, and some of the restaurants that specialize in wings, like Wingstop, were already adept at digital ordering and particularly well-suited for the pandemic, Kaiser says. Wings are also extremely simple to make. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a one-ingredient menu, right?&rdquo; says Nigam. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no barrier to entry. You and I could launch a wing brand by 6PM tonight.&rdquo; Crucially, no one brand dominated the category, and there is no proprietary wing type or sauce, so any given restaurant&rsquo;s overnight wing brand had a decent chance of winning attention on the delivery apps. This made wings an obvious first target for restaurants that had idle kitchens and needed additional revenue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It all added up to a perfect storm,&rdquo; says Portalatin, &ldquo;for wings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551409/4543_PQ_1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>&ldquo;I HAD TO GO OPEN UP A CREDIT ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO JUST CARRY ENOUGH WINGS.

Then COVID hit and his walk-in business evaporated. People were ordering dinner more than lunch, Rubin observed, and were particularly interested in &ldquo;craveable&rdquo; comfort foods, and there were only a few good wing brands in New York City, so he launched Wing Shop. &ldquo;We got lucky with that one,&rdquo; he says, being among the early entrants to the great wings rush. Now &ldquo;everyone and their mother is launching a wing concept.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big chains like Applebee&rsquo;s jumped in, first with the brand Neighborhood Wings, then with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/applebee-s-owner-says-it-found-formula-to-stand-out-on-ubereats\">Cosmic Wings</a>, an attempt to establish a proprietary moat through exclusive Cheetos dust.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/help-virtual-brand-chilis-sees-near-normal-sales-january\">Chili&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;launched It&rsquo;s just Wings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.qsrmagazine.com/emerging-concepts/smokey-bones-virtual-wing-brand-races\">Smokey Bones</a>&nbsp;barbecue chain launched The Wing Experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, virtual franchises started hitting up independent operators and pushing them to take on additional wing brands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was crazy with wings,&rdquo; says Dawn Skeete, the owner of Jam&rsquo;it Bistro. She opened her Jamaican restaurant in south Brooklyn in 2018, and when the pandemic hit, Future Foods seemed like an appealing way to test what items at what prices sold in her neighborhood. The barbecue brand, OMG BBQ LOL, didn&rsquo;t work out, but she kept going with Just Wing It. Then she took on a second wing brand, Wing Spot, after a new virtual franchise company called Acelerate.io approached her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A bag with a sticker for a fake brand called Devilish Wings next to a basket of chicken wings and a clear plastic cup with another sticker for Devilish Wings on an orange backdrop.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cumVwKrol037lY5UenP6p8ALCts=/0x0:1360x1360/fit-in/1360x1360/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544344/akrales_20210524_4543_0170_drips_sq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acelerate.io is an LA-based company founded by a former DoorDash employee named George Jacobs, who felt that for delivery to be profitable, kitchens had to increase &ldquo;throughput&rdquo; by operating multiple restaurants. The company launched in late 2019 &mdash; with a wing brand, naturally &mdash; and now runs seven brands in &ldquo;several hundred&rdquo; restaurants across the US. (It&rsquo;s spelled &ldquo;Acelerate&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;more efficient with just one c,&rdquo; Jacobs says, but also because &ldquo;accelerate.com&rdquo; was too expensive.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just Wing It and Wing Spot have the same menu, Skeete says, which helped with bulk purchases as wings got more expensive. &ldquo;Wing prices are going through the roof, and I think it has to do with all these virtual kitchens that are doing wings,&rdquo; she says. She&rsquo;s now looking to take on a third wing brand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown always made wings at The Bergen, both under his own name and Future Foods&rsquo; Killer Wings. Business was good for much of 2020. The Bergen&rsquo;s takeout and delivery-focused business was well-positioned for the spring lockdowns. It got publicity for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pix11.com/news/local-news/brooklyn/brooklyn-restaurant-the-bergen-offering-free-meals-amid-covid-19-crisis/\">donating meals</a>&nbsp;to families in need, followed by more attention as a local Black-owned establishment during the protests surrounding George Floyd&rsquo;s murder. The pace was almost more than staff could handle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by the end of the year, business was flagging, so in January, Brown responded to a pitch from Nextbite, an arm of the restaurant software company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodondemandnews.com/11112020/alex-canter-talks-ordermark-and-nextbites-120m-war-chest/\">Ordermark</a>. The company recently received a $120 million investment from SoftBank and has been expanding aggressively, offering restaurant owners, which it calls &ldquo;fulfillment partners,&rdquo; a selection of &ldquo;turnkey&rdquo; virtual brands from which to choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nextbite, man, the day I opened up that brand, they put out a lot of wings,&rdquo; says Brown. &ldquo;I had to go shop for more wings.

The move comes after Phares Lee, a transgender man who works at a Google data center in South Carolina and is employed by security subcontracting firm G4S, asked to have his deadname removed from his badge and was denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee came out as transgender during his initial interview with G4S. &ldquo;I was assured [Google] was inclusive, yet when I asked about a badge in my preferred name I was told that my badge had to reflect my legal name,&rdquo; he says in an interview with&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>. &ldquo;After arriving on site and being issued the badge with my dead name, I noticed there were many people on site, both cis and transgender, whose badges did not reflect their legal names.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee&rsquo;s experience reflects a growing sentiment within Google&rsquo;s contract workforce, that TVCs (temporary, vendor, and contract employees)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html\">do not have the same rights and benefits as full-time Google staff</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html\">Google ended a long-time policy</a>&nbsp;that forced employees to settle workplace disputes in private arbitration with the company. Yet the change did not extend to Google&rsquo;s third-party contractors. &ldquo;Contracting companies, like G4S, are allowed to make rules for their employees that directly contradict [Google&rsquo;s] commitment to inclusion,&rdquo; Lee explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee says that when he arrived at the data center, he was the only transgender security officer on site. In an attempt to connect with other LGBTQ individuals, he tried to join one of Google&rsquo;s employee resource groups, which are designed for underrepresented communities. He says G4S management told him these groups were a &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; to which contractors were not entitled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the Alphabet Workers Union is circulating a petition asking Google and G4S to adopt a chosen name policy for TVCs and full-time staff. The policy should ensure &ldquo;publicly displayed names reflect a chosen name where it differs from their legal name; allows pronoun stickers to be displayed on name badges, and protects the right to privacy of dead names,&rdquo; according to the letter. The union also wants Google and G4S to allow contractors to participate in employee resource groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The petition currently has 165 signatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither Google nor G4S responded to a request for comment from&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>NEXT UP IN&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy\">POLICY</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>', 'The move comes after a transgender man asked to have his deadname removed from his badge and was denied', 'The move comes after a transgender man asked to have his deadname removed from his badge and was denied', '1622712593_image (7).jpg', 0, '2021-06-03', 1),

Tesla&nbsp;<a href=\"https://engage.tesla.com/\">even has a page on its website</a>&nbsp;where it asks customers to engage with their elected officials about these cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connecticut, another state where direct selling isn&rsquo;t allowed (though Tesla can lease cars to customers there),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2021/03/24/tesla-lucid-rivian-other-ev-makers-scored-a-win-in-connecticut\">currently has legislation in the works</a>&nbsp;to allow direct sales, and Tesla and Rivian are working together to try and get legislation through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/ev-rivals-tesla-rivian-unite-to-target-direct-sales-legislation/\">in other states this year</a>&nbsp;as well.

Elon Musk&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1398029410289127424?s=20\">tweeted in response</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>The Drive</em>&rsquo;s article about lawmakers running out of time, pushing for a change in the state. It&rsquo;s not impossible that it could happen, even with the legislature on break until 2023: Governor Greg Abbott (who called Tesla &ldquo;one of the most exciting and innovative companies in the world&rdquo; when it announced its Texas factory) could call a special session to focus on the un-passed law.

Ultimately, any given phone&rsquo;s ability to make it through the day on its own juice will continue to be the more important factor for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>MORE FROM&nbsp;THE VERGE</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22459025/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-processor-5g-modem-computex\">Intel&rsquo;s latest 11th Gen processor brings 5.0GHz speeds to thin and light laptops</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22460946/instagram-making-changes-algorithm-censoring-pro-palestinian-content\">Instagram making changes to its algorithm after it was accused of censoring pro-Palestinian content</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22460964/vilnius-lithuania-portal-poland-connection-pandemic\">Vilnius, Lithuania built a &lsquo;portal&rsquo; to another city to help keep people connected</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22456798/new-trailers-tomorrow-war-eternals-infinite-werewolves-within-marvel-disney\">New Trailers: The Tomorrow War, Eternals, Infinite, Werewolves Within, and more</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22458629/zte-axon-30-ultra-review-screen-price-specs\">ZTE Axon 30 Ultra review: the right stuff for the right price</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459869/us-soldiers-leaked-nuclear-info-online-flashcard-apps\">US soldiers reportedly leaked nuclear info online accidentally, by using flashcard apps</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'New ‘world records’ in wired and wireless charging', 'New ‘world records’ in wired and wireless charging', 'image (7).jpg', 1, '2021-05-31', 1),

Snapdragon 888 processor? Check. Fast refresh rate screen? Check. A metric ton of rear-facing cameras? Check, check, check, and check. It&rsquo;s also priced well, starting at $749 while many of its competitors start around the $1,000 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axon 30 Ultra delivers on many fronts, like its high-quality screen and flagship-level performance. For some, that will be enough. However, it falls short in more subtle ways that you won&rsquo;t see on a spec sheet. Its novel camera array is let down by uneven, heavy-handed processing. There&rsquo;s also a stray bug here and there, which can range from harmless (a 5G on / off toggle appears twice in a quick settings menu) to more annoying (the camera shutter noise going off even in silent mode). ZTE may iron out these bugs in future updates, or they won&rsquo;t, and you&rsquo;ll be the obnoxious parent with the noisy smartphone camera during your child&rsquo;s dance recital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>THE AXON 30 ULTRA OFFERS TOP-NOTCH PERFORMANCE WITH A LARGE, LOVELY SCREEN</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And even though all of the key hardware is there, a few flagship-y features have been omitted to hit the Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s more aggressive price point. There&rsquo;s no IP rating for water resistance and no wireless charging. The phone doesn&rsquo;t work on Verizon either, just on T-Mobile and AT&amp;T, and 5G service on T-Mobile is limited to one band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If those factors aren&rsquo;t dealbreakers and you&rsquo;re comfortable working around the occasional quirk, then the Axon 30 Ultra offers top-notch performance with a large, lovely screen at a lower price than the competition. We don&rsquo;t see too many of those high-performance / lower cost premium phones in the US to challenge the heavyweights of the Android world, and it&rsquo;s nice to have an alternative. But it does lack some of the polish and a few features that distinguish the more expensive competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>OUR REVIEW OF<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/products/zte-axon-30-ultra/9596\">ZTE AXON 30 ULTRA</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>VERGE SCORE7OUT OF 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EG8P6QY51Gu_444POWNvauGap7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541796/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0001sq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GOOD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excellent performance&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Big, fast refresh rate screen</li>\r\n	<li>Great camera hardware</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>BAD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Image processing is a mixed bag</li>\r\n	<li>No IP rating</li>\r\n	<li>Doesn&rsquo;t work on Verizon</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://global.ztedevices.com/products/axon-30-ultra?_gl=1%2A79xj54%2A_ga%2AMTQ2NjcxNTcyMS4xNjE4NDM4OTI4%2A_ga_3E4J277XD6%2AMTYyMjIxOTAyNS44LjEuMTYyMjIxOTc4My42MA..&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22458629/zte-axon-30-ultra-review-screen-price-specs&amp;xcust=___vg__p_22222670__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Buy for $749.00&nbsp;from ZTE</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45Zegu7KFhFiDid_AMVjET9rW8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541699/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0004.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The 30 Ultra&rsquo;s screen is curved on the edges for a more immersive feel.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ZTE AXON 30 ULTRA SCREEN, BATTERY, AND PERFORMANCE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AtAt&nbsp;6.7 inches, the Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s screen is about as big as they come these days. It&rsquo;s a 1080p OLED with a refresh rate up to 144Hz. You can set it manually to 60, 90, 120, or 144Hz, or let it switch automatically between those rates based on the content you&rsquo;re viewing. That 144Hz rate is a little faster than the 120Hz rate you&rsquo;ll find on most high-end devices, but I&rsquo;m not sure I could tell the difference between them if I didn&rsquo;t know which was which. The bottom line is that every swipe, scroll, and animation looks incredibly smooth on the 30 Ultra&rsquo;s screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, it&rsquo;s just a really nice screen. Contrast is rich, the bezels are slim, and the panel curves over the sides of the phone; marketers love to call a screen like this &ldquo;immersive,&rdquo; but that actually feels like a fair descriptor. It&rsquo;s a little tough to see outside in bright light, but it&rsquo;s still usable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That big screen makes the Axon 30 Ultra a big device. It&rsquo;s comfortable enough to hold, and the curved screen and back panel help, but I definitely can&rsquo;t reach my thumb clear across the screen while using it one-handed. There&rsquo;s Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panels and the frame is aluminum, giving the whole phone a solid, premium feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ah5AViejfr7YFlSZM3ZX7PQfE7o=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541698/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0003.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Axon 30 Ultra offers Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back panel.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone performance also meets the &ldquo;premium&rdquo; bar, thanks to that Snapdragon 888 processor. It feels very snappy jumping between apps, pinching and zooming around Google Maps, and scrolling through Twitter. I&rsquo;m also happy to report that the in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive, too &mdash; it gave me a little thrill with every unlock and password manager authentication. It&rsquo;s a feature that goes the extra distance to making this feel like a highly responsive, premium device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s 4,600mAh battery is big enough and consistently got me through a day of moderate use. However, I was conservative with some battery-draining settings like screen refresh rate, and all of my use was on Wi-Fi, so I expect you could fully drain the battery over the course of a day if you really went for it. Wireless charging is, as mentioned earlier, not an option here, but the phone supports 65W wired charging with the included charging brick, and it is plenty fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Android 11 comes preloaded on the Axon 30 Ultra, and ZTE says an Android 12 update will come at the end of the year or in early 2022. The company doesn&rsquo;t give a firm timeline for security updates but says it generally provides them for around three years. Not the worst support policy by far, but not among the very best. ZTE&rsquo;s Android interface is called MyOS, and it&rsquo;s a straightforward affair that doesn&rsquo;t try to get too fancy. There are a truly overwhelming number of shortcuts in the fully expanded quick settings menu accessed by swiping from the top of the screen, but you can rearrange and whittle them down to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1J9uh8feknRJuWxN9icDcJqL210=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541697/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0002.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cameras galore.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ZTE AXON 30 ULTRA CAMERAS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>RatherRather&nbsp;than one high-resolution main camera complemented by several lower-resolution sensors, ZTE has chosen to put three 64-megapixel sensors in the Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s rear camera array. You&rsquo;ll find a standard wide-angle main camera with optical stabilization, a 35mm-equivalent wide-angle for portraits, and an ultrawide. There&rsquo;s also an 8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera with optical stabilization. It&rsquo;s a lot of cameras, and none of them are throwaways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s cameras are impressive, but they&rsquo;re also a little frustrating. First, the good: these three 64-megapixel cameras all capture a lot of detail in good light, which I&rsquo;d expect from the main camera, but that isn&rsquo;t always the case with ultrawides since they tend to have lower resolution chips. The telephoto module offers 5x true optical zoom &mdash; results aren&rsquo;t great indoors or in dim light, but with plenty of available light, it&rsquo;s much better than the digital zoom alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also really like the portrait lens, which is wider than the telephoto options most other smartphone cameras use. This is a personal preference; I like getting more of the scene in portrait photos, you may not. There&rsquo;s no option to digitally zoom in while using portrait mode if you don&rsquo;t like the wide-angle look, and portrait mode photos (with artificially blurred backgrounds) can only be taken with the dedicated portrait lens or the selfie camera. Something to consider if wide portraits are really not your thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;GRID VIEW</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wofBC3OOZAa850e4jCDgF7l3YBs=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546276/IMG_20210522_051947.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 of 12</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the bad: image processing (particularly color and saturation) is inconsistent between cameras, and two photos from the same camera can vary noticeably with slight shifts in composition or subject positioning. Images from the main camera often look oversaturated. Most of the time it&rsquo;s subtle enough not to bother me much, but then I&rsquo;ll take a picture of my orange cat and he&rsquo;ll look like a Cheeto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portrait mode photos suffer some misses, too: subject separation from blurred backgrounds can look a little clumsy, and the lack of OIS in the portrait camera means you&rsquo;re more likely to see slight blur in dimmer conditions, even without much camera movement. The wider focal length also means you&rsquo;ll need to crank up the blur if you want to obscure a distracting background, which makes the subject cut-out problems more obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>WHEN THE AXON 30 ULTRA DOES GET THINGS RIGHT, IMAGES LOOK REALLY GOOD</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe these shortcomings are more frustrating because when the Axon 30 Ultra does get things right, images look really good. Exposure is well balanced, all four cameras are genuinely useful, and each of them offers an impressive level of detail retention. I&rsquo;d entertain leaving my dedicated camera at home more often with this combination of focal lengths and capabilities, but image processing is too much of a wild card for me to feel comfortable with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the Axon 30 Ultra&rsquo;s most annoying bugs lives in the camera app, too: the camera shutter sound is permanently stuck on, even with every volume control set to silent. There&rsquo;s no way to turn it off in the camera settings menu or the main settings menu. I hate this. Maybe some people could live with it. Maybe you can root your phone and eliminate the problem yourself. Maybe ZTE will fix the issue soon. All I know is that I cannot live a shutter-sound-on lifestyle and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing I might return a phone over, no matter how good the pictures look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbiJmk7KSBe3lZqJX6LZdnKHF_c=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541700/ajohnson_20210524_4601_0005.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Axon 30 Ultra is missing a few flagship-y features like wireless charging, but it doesn&rsquo;t skimp on build quality.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheThe&nbsp;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra is exactly what it appears to be: a lower cost alternative to the big Android flagships with top-tier performance and a great screen. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it to just anyone, and you need to be comfortable either living with a couple of quirks or navigating a way around them. You don&rsquo;t quite get the same level of polish or reassurance that you would from a Samsung, OnePlus, or Google device, but in return you get excellent performance for the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axon 30 Ultra has a healthy price advantage over the other big-screen-big-performance competition like the $1,069 OnePlus 9 Pro and the $999 Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. If you&rsquo;re willing to concede some screen real estate, then its advantage narrows compared to the OnePlus 9 ($729) and standard Galaxy S21 ($800). With either of those options, you&rsquo;ll get the same excellent performance and a few other benefits, like wireless charging and more sophisticated image processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>THE AXON 30 ULTRA HAS A HEALTHY PRICE ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER BIG-SCREEN-BIG-PERFORMANCE COMPETITION</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s an important caveat that the Axon 30 Ultra doesn&rsquo;t work on Verizon. That will rule out a significant number of prospective customers in the US. And I wish the cameras lived up to their hardware potential more often. If that&rsquo;s not much of a concern, you&rsquo;re not a Verizon customer, and your priorities are set on a big screen and snappy day-to-day performance, then you have a great option in the 30 Ultra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that said, I can&rsquo;t see a reason not to buy the Axon 30 Ultra if none of the above concerns you. You&rsquo;ll get excellent performance, a massive screen with a silky smooth fast refresh rate, and great camera hardware &mdash; and you can rub it in your friends&rsquo; faces when you pay several hundred dollars less for your phone than they did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photography by Allison Johnson / The Verge</em></p>', 'If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.

It&rsquo;s so thin, it has two screens, the hinge is incredibly neat.

Instead, priced at &euro;599 (about $730), the ZenFone 8 lands in the upper-midrange class with a conventional rear camera bump and a much smaller 5.9-inch display. As a side note, final US pricing is TBD &mdash; Asus says somewhere between $599 and $799 &mdash; but it will be coming to North America, unlike last year&rsquo;s model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than an attention-grabbing camera feature, the focus of this design has been to create a smaller phone that&rsquo;s comfortable to use in one hand, which Asus has done without skimping on processing power or higher-end features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s an Android iPhone mini, and it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>OUR REVIEW OF<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/products/asus-zenfone-8/9583\">ASUS ZENFONE 8</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>VERGE SCORE8OUT OF 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRWhucyqcsQWrUdGd9sSMk4YSzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499352/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0001sq.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GOOD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Thoughtful compact design</li>\r\n	<li>Robust build quality and IP68 rating</li>\r\n	<li>Excellent Snapdragon 888 performance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>BAD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Battery life is just okay</li>\r\n	<li>Only two major OS updates</li>\r\n	<li>No telephoto camera</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZo6_2wj-LRtpeo90l3wL7fgYDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499353/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0002.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Asus designed the ZenFone 8 with one-handed operation in mind.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ASUS ZENFONE 8 SCREEN AND DESIGN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>TheThe&nbsp;ZenFone 8 may be small, but that hasn&rsquo;t kept it from offering the latest flagship processor: a Snapdragon 888 chipset, coupled with 6, 8, or 16GB of RAM (my review unit has 16GB). I can&rsquo;t find fault with this phone&rsquo;s performance. It feels responsive, animations and interactions are smooth, and it keeps up with demanding use and rapid app switching. This is performance fitting of a flagship device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display is a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED panel with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that makes routine interactions with the phone &mdash; swiping, scrolling, animations &mdash; look much more smooth and polished than a standard 60Hz screen or even a 90Hz panel. By default, the phone will automatically switch between 120 / 90 / 60Hz depending on the application to save battery life, but you can manually select any of those three refresh rates if you prefer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display&rsquo;s 20:9 aspect ratio was carefully considered by Asus. The company says it settled on this slightly narrower format so the phone would fit more easily into a pocket, and it does. I can&rsquo;t get it&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the way into a back jeans pocket, but it mostly fits. More importantly, it fits well inside a jacket pocket and doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s going to flop out if I sit down on the floor to tie my shoes. The ZenFone 8 is rated IP68 for dust protection and some water submersion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>I CAN&rsquo;T GET IT&nbsp;<em>ALL</em>&nbsp;THE WAY INTO A BACK JEANS POCKET, BUT IT MOSTLY FITS</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass Victus and houses an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the back uses Gorilla Glass 3 with a frosted finish that&rsquo;s on the matte side of the matte / glossy spectrum. The front panel is flat, but the rear features a slight curve on the long edges for an easier fit in the hand. At 169 grams (5.9 ounces), it&rsquo;s heavy for its size, and it feels surprisingly dense when you first pick it up. The phone&rsquo;s frame is aluminum, giving the whole package a high-end look and feel. There&rsquo;s even a headphone jack on the top edge as a treat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power button (an exciting shade of blue!) is well-positioned so my right thumb falls on it naturally with the phone in my hand. Same for the in-screen fingerprint sensor: the target appears to be positioned higher on the screen than usual, but that actually puts it within a comfortable reach of my thumb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll admit up front that I have a personal bias toward smaller phones, but the ZenFone 8 just feels great in my hand. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time using big devices over the last six months, and I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. But the ZenFone 8 is the first device that feels like it was adapted to&nbsp;<em>me,</em>&nbsp;not something I&rsquo;ve had to adapt to using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BEgC7hZxulpOrJD0OOJ9ag9GPzo=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499355/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0004.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A smaller phone means a smaller battery.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ASUS ZENFONE 8 BATTERY AND SOFTWARE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>TheThe&nbsp;phone&rsquo;s small size makes a smaller battery a necessity &mdash; 4,000mAh in this case, much smaller than the ZenFone 6 and 7&rsquo;s 5,000mAh. I felt the difference in using this phone versus a battery-for-days budget or midrange phone, but I had no problem getting through a full day of moderate use. I even left Strava running for 20 hours by accident, and the battery still had some life in it the next morning. The ZenFone 8 supports 30W wired charging with the included power adapter, which takes an empty battery to 100 percent in a bit more than an hour. Wireless charging isn&rsquo;t supported, which makes the ZenFone 8 a bit of an outlier in the flagship class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asus offers a ton of options to help stretch day-to-day battery life as well as the overall lifespan of your battery. There are no fewer than five battery modes to optimize phone performance or battery longevity on a daily basis, and different charging modes let you set a custom charging limit or stagger charging overnight so it reaches 100 percent around the time of your alarm for better battery health. You won&rsquo;t find class-leading battery capacity here, but rest assured if you need to stretch the ZenFone 8&rsquo;s battery, there are plenty of options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ZenFone 8 ships with Android 11, and Asus says it will provide &ldquo;at least&rdquo; two major OS with security updates for the same timeframe. That&rsquo;s on the low side of what we&rsquo;d expect for a flagship phone, especially compared to Apple&rsquo;s typical four- or five-year support schedule. An important note for US shoppers is that the ZenFone 8 will only work with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile&rsquo;s LTE and Sub-6GHz 5G networks; you can&rsquo;t use this phone on Verizon, and there&rsquo;s no support for the fast, but extremely limited, millimeter-wave 5G networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4YP0oR7_eBpWviD2MTVxO-d2kQo=/0x0:2000x1333/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1333):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507533/DSC00661_rear.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The ZenFone 8 offers standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ASUS ZENFONE 8 CAMERA</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>ThereThere&nbsp;are just two cameras on the ZenFone 8&rsquo;s rear camera bump, and they are both worth your time. Rather than cram in a depth sensor, macro, or some monochrome nonsense, Asus just went with a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. They&rsquo;re borrowed from last year&rsquo;s model, minus a telephoto camera and the flipping mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in the ZenFone 7 Pro, the 8&rsquo;s main camera produces 16-megapixel images with vibrant color and plenty of detail in good light. Images can lean a little too far into unnatural-looking territory, and some high-contrast scenes look a little too HDR-y for my liking. But overall, this camera does fine: it handles moderately low-light conditions like a dim store interior well, and Night Mode does an okay job in very low light, provided you can hold the phone still for a few seconds and your subject isn&rsquo;t moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;GRID VIEW</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/raINO8fuI0YrOXayumiFlBn95xo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507623/P_20210509_130526.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 of 20</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A skin-smoothing beauty mode is on by default when you use portrait mode, and it is not good. Skin looks over-smoothed, unnaturally flat, and brightened, like your subject is wearing a couple of layers of stage makeup. Turning this off improves things significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultrawide camera also turns in good performance. Asus calls it a &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; grade sensor, and while that might have been true in 2018, it&rsquo;s at least a step up from the smaller, cheaper sensors often found in ultrawide cameras. Likewise, the front-facing 12-megapixel camera does fine. Beauty mode is turned off by default when you switch to the selfie camera, and thank goodness for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no telephoto camera here, just digital zoom. On the camera shooting screen, there&rsquo;s an icon to jump to a 2x 16-megapixel &ldquo;lossless&rdquo; digital zoom to crop in quickly, which works okay, but it isn&rsquo;t much reach, and it just makes the limitations of the small sensor and lens more obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the whole, the camera system is good but not great. The lack of true optical zoom or a telephoto camera is a disappointment, but you can&rsquo;t have everything on such a small device, and I&rsquo;d personally take an ultrawide before a telephoto any day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHe4SfbPwXz2XvLpY8WAo3EZso4=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499354/ajohnson_20210505_4575_0003.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The ZenFone 8 doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice a flagship experience to achieve its small form factor.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheThe&nbsp;ZenFone 8 fills a void in the Android market for a full-specced, small-sized device. The Google Pixel 4A is around the same size, but it&rsquo;s decidedly a budget device with a step-down processor, plastic chassis, and fewer niceties like an IP rating or a fast-refresh screen. Aside from battery life, which is manageable, you give up very little in the way of flagship features to get the ZenFone 8&rsquo;s small form factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to look to iOS for this phone&rsquo;s most direct competition: the iPhone 12 mini, which it matches almost spec-for-spec from the IP rating down to the camera configuration. The 12 mini is actually a little smaller than the ZenFone 8, and when you factor in storage capacity, it&rsquo;s likely to be the more expensive choice at $829 for 256GB. However, when you consider that the 12 mini will probably get a couple more years of OS and security support, it may be the better buy in the long run, if you&rsquo;re flexible in your choice of operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>FLAGSHIP-LEVEL BUILD QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE QUITE LITERALLY IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the ZenFone 8 a lot, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;ll find a big audience, at least in the US. Apple is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease\">having trouble selling the iPhone 12 mini</a>, and if there&rsquo;s one thing Apple is good at, it&rsquo;s selling phones to US customers. As much as I hate to entertain the idea, maybe we&rsquo;ve gotten used to giant phones. I love how the ZenFone 8 feels in my hand and in my pocket, but I do notice how much smaller the screen and everything on it seems compared to the bigger phones I&rsquo;ve used recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a few important considerations, like the lack of compatibility with Verizon and the comparatively short support lifespan of the phone. If you need the absolute best in battery life the ZenFone 8 can&rsquo;t offer that, and if you want a class-leading camera, you&rsquo;ll need to look elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that said, the ZenFone 8 will be the right fit for a specific type of person, and I can heartily recommend it to my fellow small phone fans. You&rsquo;ll get flagship-level build quality and performance quite literally in the palm of your hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photography by Allison Johnson / The Verge</em></p>', 'The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package', 'The ZenFone 8 delivers flagship-level build quality and performance in a small package', 'image (8).jpg', 1, '2021-05-31', 1),

Smartphones&rsquo; upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don&rsquo;t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It&rsquo;s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review\"><strong>Apple iPhone 12</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, if you&rsquo;re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price\"><strong>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</strong></a>&nbsp;is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android\">check out our guide to budget smartphones</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone &mdash; so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir%26afid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;sharedid=VergeBestPhoneRightNow051321\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g40rjdJm4g1V2gK5KJoaKpVbEKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x1200/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21973505/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir%26afid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;sharedid=VergeBestPhoneRightNow051321\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APPLE IPHONE 12</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$799</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting at $799, the iPhone 12 comes in three different storage configurations: 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB.

Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>THE IPHONE 12 BALANCES A BIG SCREEN WITH MANAGEABLE SIZE WELL</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery &mdash; two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it&rsquo;s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn&rsquo;t so big that it&rsquo;s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that&rsquo;s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that&rsquo;s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12&rsquo;s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you&rsquo;d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 12 has Apple&rsquo;s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it&rsquo;s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VhkcO4raREzH4chnbejAaD_6XNc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248903/vpavic_210119_4377_0153.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 ULTRA</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>BEST ANDROID PHONE TO BUY IN 2021</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it&rsquo;s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it&rsquo;s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can&rsquo;t say we like Samsung&rsquo;s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it&rsquo;s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it&rsquo;s worth looking around for a deal before buying.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mzp2-knGrJWeYI-RWfCFB2tPre4=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258914/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 / S21 PLUS</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>BEST ANDROID PHONE TO FIND A DEAL FOR</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don&rsquo;t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We&rsquo;ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it&rsquo;s a minor refresh over last year&rsquo;s Galaxy S20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1614285-REG/samsung_sm_g991uzaexaa_s21_256gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone&amp;xcust=___vg__p_21927852__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVGteL82Bmw244OrtU6VSeOB8PM=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x1200/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258907/vpavic_210118_4378_0197.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1614285-REG/samsung_sm_g991uzaexaa_s21_256gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone&amp;xcust=___vg__p_21927852__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 (256GB, UNLOCKED)</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$800</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>$850</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>6% off</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most affordable model in the S21 line has a 6.2-inch 1080p screen and refresh rates up to 120Hz.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1614285-REG/samsung_sm_g991uzaexaa_s21_256gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone&amp;xcust=___vg__p_21927852__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$800&nbsp;AT B&amp;H PHOTO</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?ots=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]21927852[t]w[r]theverge.com/phone-review[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xb4HmtRdNY9RjmvGUf2n1_UhZGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x1200/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232920/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0005.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?ots=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]21927852[t]w[r]theverge.com/phone-review[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY S21 PLUS (128GB, UNLOCKED)</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$1,000</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galaxy S21 Plus includes a 6.7-inch 1080p screen with storage configurations of 128GB and 256GB.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?ots=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]21927852[t]w[r]theverge.com/phone-review[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000&nbsp;AT AMAZON</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1614292-REG/samsung_sm_g996uzkaxaa_s21_128gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;xcust=___vg__p_21927852__t_w__r_theverge.com/phone-revie\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000&nbsp;AT B&amp;H PHOTO</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/buy/galaxy-s21-plus-5g-128gb-unlocked-sm-g996uzkaxaa/?nrtv_cid=.nrtv_plchldr.&amp;cid=opmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mob-042720-142014-nymag-6685905&amp;utm_source=nymag&amp;utm_medium=narrativ&amp;utm_campaign=6685905&amp;utm_content=mob\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000&nbsp;AT SAMSUNG</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVPwPyECmoRej8Ys1x-O9IJjKEU=/0x0:2050x1367/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2050x1367):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022582/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APPLE IPHONE 12 PRO MAX</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>BEST PHONE FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO IN 2021</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras &mdash; standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto &mdash; combine with Apple&rsquo;s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn&rsquo;t the best iPhone for most people. It&rsquo;s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies.

The iPhone 12 mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don&rsquo;t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it&rsquo;s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini&rsquo;s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you&rsquo;re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it&rsquo;s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won&rsquo;t need a PopSocket on this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It&rsquo;s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you prefer Android, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asus Zenfone 8</a>&nbsp;is a good alternative. It&rsquo;s a little bigger than the 12 mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn&rsquo;t work on Verizon, but it&rsquo;s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1032524/7613?sharedid=VergeBestPhonetoBuy04192021&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJjR0RcS1zH-ANNyeeRcX3XMzM4=/0x0:2050x1367/1200x1200/filters:focal(1025x684:1026x685)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22015271/cgartenberg_201105_4276_005.0.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1032524/7613?sharedid=VergeBestPhonetoBuy04192021&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APPLE IPHONE 12 MINI</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$699</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPhone 12 Mini is the smallest phone in Apple&rsquo;s lineup and the best small phone you can get.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1032524/7613?sharedid=VergeBestPhonetoBuy04192021&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$699&nbsp;AT APPLE</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/iphone/iphone-12-mini-shop-by-carrier/pcmcat1602690175713.c\" rel=\"nofollow noskim\" target=\"_blank\">$699&nbsp;AT BEST BUY</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fswxTjsimE7iN0xCynKVtVaIWTw=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21765222/vpavic_200807_4133_0116.0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has the battery life you need to go all day long.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 20 ULTRA</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>IF YOU WANT A STYLUS BUILT INTO YOUR PHONE</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung&rsquo;s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung&rsquo;s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn&rsquo;t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung&rsquo;s plans, this may be the last &ldquo;Ultra&rdquo; version of the Note, too &mdash; though rumors have been conflicting on that front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Unlocked-Smartphone-Long-Lasting/dp/B08BX7N9SK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;linkId=812b275d8ab6e0bc27fe57b38466b7a2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]21927852[t]w[r]theverge.com/phone-review[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lnO9w_fVDHboWra4ITj8a8_PAw=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x1200/filters:focal(760x678:761x679)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21696153/bfarsace_200803_4124_0016.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Unlocked-Smartphone-Long-Lasting/dp/B08BX7N9SK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;linkId=812b275d8ab6e0bc27fe57b38466b7a2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]21927852[t]w[r]theverge.com/phone-review[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 20 ULTRA</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$1,300</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is one of Samsung&rsquo;s top-tier non-folding phones, and it has excellent battery life.</p>', 'Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you', 'Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you', 'image (9).jpg', 1, '2021-05-31', 1),

With its latest pair, Beats is hoping to attract a much wider audience. That starts with the price,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]22297011[t]w[r]theverge.com[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which is $149.99</a>&nbsp;&mdash; a full $100 less than the AirPods Pro. For the first time in Beats earbuds, they include active noise cancellation. And with other new features, Beats is extending an olive branch to Android users, which might come as a surprise for a brand that&rsquo;s owned by Apple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beats says it has put an incredible amount of work into how the Studio Buds sound. That&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re supposed to exceed expectations for the price. But you don&rsquo;t get everything under the sun for $150; the most obvious missing piece is wireless charging. And their noise cancellation and transparency modes don&rsquo;t keep pace with some pricier earbuds, including the AirPods Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>OUR REVIEW OF<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/products/studio-buds/9611\">BEATS STUDIO BUDS</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>VERGE SCORE7.5OUT OF 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/hermano/verge/product/image/9611/DSCF4126_Edited.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GOOD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Compact, comfortable design</li>\r\n	<li>Good sound quality for the price</li>\r\n	<li>USB-C</li>\r\n	<li>They support Android features</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>BAD STUFF</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Poor noise cancellation</li>\r\n	<li>Disappointing mic performance</li>\r\n	<li>No wireless charging</li>\r\n	<li>They don&rsquo;t offer all of Apple&rsquo;s software tricks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1743418624738078568?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22297011%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bd%5DD\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Buy for $149.99&nbsp;from Best Buy</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1645487-REG/beats_by_dr_dre_mj503ll_a_studio_buds_noise_canceling_true.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review&amp;xcust=___vg__p_22297011__t_w__r_theverge.com__d_D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Buy for $149.99&nbsp;from B&amp;H Photo</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]22297011[t]w[r]theverge.com[d]D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Buy for $149.99&nbsp;from Amazon</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Studio Buds have a small, light stem-less design that loses the ear hooks of the Powerbeats Pro. They look downright miniature in comparison. And the weight difference is also substantial: each of the Studio Buds is 5.1 grams, which is far more comfortable on your ears than the 20-gram Powerbeats Pro. They&rsquo;re also slightly lighter than the AirPods Pro, Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Buds Pro, Anker&rsquo;s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro, Jabra&rsquo;s Elite 85t/75t, and many others on the market. There&rsquo;s a tiny micro-venting hole meant to reduce that clogged-up pressure feeling in your ear, and Beats includes the standard three sizes of silicone ear tips. Fit is a big plus; the Studio Buds feel extremely comfortable and never fatigued my ears at any point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8h1HRlrFgOdNXnv5m1IYsjvCJA=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657483/DSCF4186_Edited.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Beats Studio Buds are much smaller than the previous Powerbeats Pro.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beats leaned on learnings from its prior earbuds (and those from Apple) as it worked on this design; it also went through some prototyping with consumers to land on the final form factor. The outward-facing side is contoured around a diagonal pill-shaped &ldquo;b&rdquo; button. It&rsquo;s tactile and actually presses in instead of relying on capacitive touch sensors. I greatly prefer this approach since you won&rsquo;t have to deal with accidental presses as often when adjusting the earbuds. The button only requires a light press, so you&rsquo;re not constantly jamming the buds deeper into your ears. Controls work identically on both sides: press once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, three to go back, and long-press to toggle between ANC on / transparency / off. You can customize the long-press to activate a voice assistant instead, but that&rsquo;s as far as Beats lets you switch things up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oval charging case is mercifully way smaller than the giant one that holds the Powerbeats Pro, and the red color of my review unit is quite eye-catching. There&rsquo;s also something reassuring about how strongly the Studio Buds are magnetically pulled into their slots. I&rsquo;m hopeful these will avoid the occasional only-one-earbud-actually-charged failures of the Powerbeats Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Koq7I-z0ukC_88_Kt_3ex6QNfzc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657689/DSCF4150_Edited_2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The charging case is also much more pocketable.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d say the most curious thing about the Studio Buds hardware is what&rsquo;s been left out: there&rsquo;s no Apple-made chip inside these. The Powerbeats Pro, Powerbeats, and even the $50 Beats Flex neckband earbuds all have one of Apple&rsquo;s branded chips inside &mdash; either the H1 or W1 &mdash; for features like instant setup, automatic pairing across all Apple devices that are signed in to your iCloud account, and audio sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the lack of Apple silicon, Beats has managed to replicate some of those conveniences through software. The Studio Buds support hands-free &ldquo;Hey Siri&rdquo; voice commands. When you pop open the case near an iPhone for the first time, you&rsquo;ll see the familiar setup screen (or at least something close) slide up from the bottom, just like with AirPods or other Beats products. The Studio Buds even have special integration in Control Center: you can switch between noise-canceling and transparency modes from here just as you can with the AirPods Pro. They&rsquo;ll also automatically play&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Music&rsquo;s new Dolby Atmos spatial audio tracks</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pBhXKjKI7xNcNDj8WWl8jqo-mM=/0x0:2040x997/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x997):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657522/beatsios.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Despite having no Apple chip inside, the Studio Buds replicate some AirPods features through software.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the illusion only stretches so far. If you go looking for them, you&rsquo;ll notice MIA features that would&rsquo;ve been present if the Studio Buds contained a proper Apple chip. Pairing them with your iPhone does<em>&nbsp;not&nbsp;</em>sync them across your other iCloud devices. Audio sharing is nowhere to be found. And the Studio Buds lack the ability to automatically hop between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac based on whichever one you&rsquo;re actively using. (They don&rsquo;t have multipoint either, so losing those seamless handoffs is all the more apparent.) These are minor sacrifices, but they do put the Studio Buds behind Apple&rsquo;s headphones or even other Beats models in terms of supporting Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8xwzF9RHaW8GQPFtHTRQkSuJTo0=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657477/DSCF4104_Edited.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>There&rsquo;s a tactile &ldquo;b&rdquo; button on each earbud for controls.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uL47zRWMxIzUXl3cqAXPtwoXg0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657476/DSCF4102_Edited.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The case has enough juice for two extra top-offs.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My hunch is that Beats likely had to leave out Apple silicon in order to include Android-specific features. The Studio Buds go farther than any of the company&rsquo;s recent products in accommodating Android listeners. First of all, they charge via USB-C. They also support Fast Pair, so they&rsquo;ll automatically be linked to your Google account after initial setup. Both the earbuds and case now natively appear in Android&rsquo;s Bluetooth settings, where you can see their battery status or see the location where they were last paired to your phone. (This means the earbuds support both Apple&rsquo;s Find My network and Google&rsquo;s equivalent.) But you don&rsquo;t get hands-free Google Assistant, which was probably a bridge too far for an Apple-owned company to make happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-6MEj0DmxXyYzg3xQlvwT8vE_Z4=/0x0:1694x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1694x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657533/android.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Beats now supports native Android features like Fast Pair.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now onto the sound. The Beats Studio Buds feature a new driver architecture, so while the company aimed for its signature &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; sound, there&rsquo;s a noticeable difference when you compare these to the Powerbeats Pro. Each has its own strengths. If you care most about driving bass to keep you motivated during exercise, the older earbuds still edge these out. The Powerbeats Pro sound still comes through as punchier to me. But the Studio Buds are better balanced with increased clarity and separation across the frequency range. Whereas the Powerbeats Pro tend to deemphasize the mids, they&rsquo;re not as lost in the shuffle here. The EQ has improved refinement, though it&rsquo;s still the usual curve that lifts the bass and treble, and highs can sometimes give off more sibilance than I&rsquo;d prefer. Overall, the Studio Buds sound plenty good, but for all of the talk about proprietary acoustic diaphragms and custom-built drivers, Beats isn&rsquo;t flipping the script on what to expect for this amount of money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it needs to do better elsewhere. Passive noise isolation on the Studio Buds still leaves something to be desired. Even with a good seal, you&rsquo;re not going to feel especially blocked off from the outside world. And unfortunately, Beats&rsquo; noise cancellation system is one of the weaker showings you&rsquo;ll find in this price range. Beats says it dynamically adapts the strength of noise cancellation based on ambient noise, but I was underwhelmed in most scenarios where I tested it. The Studio Buds do a poor job at eliminating basic traffic street noise, which makes me wary of how they&rsquo;d manage on a plane. The transparency mode also lacks the natural feeling of the AirPods Pro and other premium buds like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. You don&rsquo;t have to spend a hundred dollars more to get better results: to my ears, Amazon&rsquo;s second-generation Echo Buds surpass the Studio Buds in both noise cancellation and transparency mode for less money than the Beats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AGREE TO CONTINUE: BEATS STUDIO BUDS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it &mdash; contracts that no one actually reads. It&rsquo;s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit &ldquo;agree&rdquo; to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don&rsquo;t read and definitely can&rsquo;t negotiate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use the Beats Studio Buds out of the box without agreeing to anything by pairing them over Bluetooth as usual. However, using the Siri assistant on the iPhone or iPad means you&rsquo;re subject to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/improving-siris-privacy-protections/&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-noise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price&amp;xcust=___vg__p_22297011__t_w__r_bing.com__d_D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple&rsquo;s privacy policy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, if you install the company&rsquo;s Android app, you&rsquo;re asked if you want to automatically send analytics data to Apple. &ldquo;Apple collects information about your Beats app and Beats product, such as the software versions, device rename occurrences, and device update success and fail rates, in order to improve the product.&rdquo; Apple says none of this data allows the company to personally identify you. Firmware can also be updated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.beatsbydre.com/support/how-to/firmware-updates-beats-updater\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">via Beats&rsquo; desktop app</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Beats app also requests background location permission so it can &ldquo;connect to your Beats instantly, check battery status on the fly, and access deeper functionality.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final tally: no mandatory agreements, but there are one or more optional ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Battery life is rated at around five hours with noise cancellation active or eight without, and the case can provide two additional top-offs. The Studio Buds are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, making them workout-ready and splash-proof. And you can use either earbud independently if you want to keep one of your ears free. Voice call performance was pretty rough outdoors in busy environments, and callers found it difficult to make out my voice from the background noise. Things improved some indoors, but mic performance is another area where the Studio Buds lag competitors and their compact design might be working against them. Another annoyance is that these buds don&rsquo;t have any kind of sensors to detect when they&rsquo;ve been removed from your ears, so music won&rsquo;t pause automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6h0M-rppKrF4yjiuro5CUIC5utw=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657478/DSCF4120_Edited.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Studio Buds can last for five hours with noise cancellation on or eight with it off.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IUikAiH_hZr2tlTSHEFEZavhgV4=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657482/DSCF4162_Edited.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>They&rsquo;re also rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are aspects of the Beats Studio Buds that I really like. They&rsquo;re remarkably comfortable and have simple, easy controls. It&rsquo;s good that the company is shifting to a more even-handed strategy that appeals to both iPhone and Android users. And the sound is enjoyable and detailed, if not earth-shattering for $150. But they settle for mediocre active noise cancellation, lack wireless charging, and come with an incomplete grab bag of Apple ecosystem bells and whistles. It feels like Beats tried to do a little too much all at once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you already have the Powerbeats Pro and are happy with them, there&rsquo;s not much about the Studio Buds that warrants an upgrade. Like a lot of rivals battling it out at this price, they&rsquo;re perfectly adequate, but they lack any one must-have standout thing. Considering the cultural clout that the Beats brand still possesses, that still might be enough for them to be a hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photography by Chris Welch / The Verge</em></p>', 'Beats tried to do a lot at once — probably too much — with its new earbuds', 'Beats tried to do a lot at once — probably too much — with its new earbuds', '1623697574_DSCF4152_Edited.0.webp', 1, '2021-06-14', 3),

Google says that there are over three billion users of its Workspace apps &mdash; though it&rsquo;s probably a safe bet that Gmail accounts for a healthy chunk of that userbase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of people will soon have the option to switch over to Google&rsquo;s more modern system for Gmail, Docs, and Chat. All of them can be integrated in a single tab more easily, for example with chats sliding over to the left to reveal a shared spreadsheet. It&rsquo;s also related to the company&rsquo;s new &ldquo;smart canvas&rdquo; push, which is also designed to interlink its various apps via &ldquo;smart chips.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get started, Google is now officially offering the setting to turn on Google Chat to all users. It&rsquo;s a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9341104\">setting within Gmail</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the switch, Google Chat messaging should be an option for all now, which can include direct messages and chat Rooms. But Google is also introducing a new terminology to go along with the announcement. It is announcing the &ldquo;evolution of Rooms in Google Chat to Spaces.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Space is essentially the same thing as a chat Room, but Google wants to separate them out into their own top-level form of communication next to Gmail, Chat, and Meet. Google is layering on a few new features like improved message threading, more emoji reactions, user roles, moderation tools, and &ldquo;discoverable&rdquo; spaces. In that sense, it seems that Spaces wants to serve both as a Slack competitor and as a competitor for public Discord groups and, well, maybe as an optional replacement for email groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a little confusing &mdash; but that&rsquo;s par for the course for Google&rsquo;s messaging strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Google Spaces\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j7xjxxWNZ_0fxk31nnUjwEYqYq0=/0x0:3840x2400/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22656698/Spaces_static_image___Fam_Reunion.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Spaces</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Google</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key idea, according to Sanaz Ahari, senior director of product, is that users can more easily switch between &ldquo;modalities&rdquo; of communication. The intent is to &ldquo;keep the context,&rdquo; Ahari says. &ldquo;If you start something with an email and then you want to upgrade it into more real-time interaction between a group &mdash; or even for a project &mdash; you&rsquo;re able to do that and you can keep the context. Then you can all seamlessly upgrade into a meeting at the same time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google is promising it will &ldquo;launch a streamlined and flexible user interface&rdquo; for Spaces this summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those aren&rsquo;t the only announcements getting bundled into today&rsquo;s Workspace news. The company is launching a new tier called &ldquo;Google Workspace Individual&rdquo; at $9.99 per month, which gives users more Workspace tools without requiring them to set up their own domain or custom email address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Workspace users say yes to a meeting, they will be able to indicate whether they&rsquo;ll be attending remotely or in the reserved meeting room. Google also provided a date for the Companion Mode feature, which encourages people in the meeting room to also turn on their cameras so that remote workers don&rsquo;t feel quite as left out &mdash; it should be coming in September to desktop and &ldquo;soon&rdquo; to mobile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google also snuck in an announcement that it will&nbsp;<em>finally</em>&nbsp;offer a progressive web app for Google Workspace in September. In theory, it could make it much easier for Gmail users to have their email and other Google apps feel more like actual desktop apps and not just tabs in the browser. That&rsquo;s possible now via various Electron apps and Single Site Browser windows, but it requires more work than it should.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Google is adding enterprise options that are going to be necessary if it really wants to have a shot at going after larger companies. Corporations will be able to use their own client-side encryption for data, add more &ldquo;trust rules&rdquo; for various Drive files to simplify access and permissions, and label files based on their sensitivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Workspace has been rapidly updating and iterating over the past few months, a sign perhaps that the company really does intend to seriously compete with Microsoft. Google&rsquo;s strategy goes beyond just improving its products &mdash; it&rsquo;s more tightly integrating them together. Gmail users will soon find more prompts than ever to bring them into Google&rsquo;s other Workspace products &mdash; and some no doubt will be looking for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21265533/google-meet-gmail-hide-video-call-email-shortcut\">ways to avoid all that</a>. Putting buttons for Chat, Meet, and Rooms (soon to be Spaces) at the bottom of the most popular email app in the world is sure to raise usage &mdash; and potentially some antitrust eyebrows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest question mark is whether Google can coherently explain the switchover to Chat, why it&rsquo;s worth it, and what this new Spaces thing really is. Now that Workspace is going to be available to over three billion regular people, the company is going to need to work hard to clearly communicate with all of them.</p>', 'That’s over three billion potential users', 'That’s over three billion potential users', '1623698013_Spaces_static_image___Fam_Reunion.0.webp', 1, '2021-06-14', 3),

Dell has finally released an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop/xn9310cto235h\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OLED version of its XPS 13</a>, and I&rsquo;m typing this review on it right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The test unit I was sent has a Core i7-1185G7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. The OLED configuration costs exactly the same as an identically specced non-OLED 4K model ($1,699.99), and $300 more than an identically specced FHD touchscreen model. Nothing else about this XPS is new: it has the same thin and light build, the same tiny bezels and webcam, the same glass-fiber palm rests, and the same 16:10 aspect ratio as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features\">past couple</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price\">Dell XPS 13s</a>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve reviewed. So the considerations here really come down to how much you need an OLED screen and what you&rsquo;re willing to sacrifice for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RELATED</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features\">Dell XPS 13 (late-2020) review: greatness, refined</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">Best laptop 2021: 15 best laptops you can buy</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Dell XPS 13 seen from the right side.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kumJG0fh0kwAgf6zYXidUpNRw9I=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653795/mchin_20190905_4631_0002.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>It looks just like the previous XPS 13.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display itself is great. It&rsquo;s a 3.5K (3456 x 2160) panel with a claimed 100,000:1 contrast ratio. It maxed out our colorimeter, covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It&rsquo;s not as bright as the FHD model but is still plenty bright, maxing out at 369 nits. I had no problem using the device outside and was usually using it below 30 percent brightness while indoors. Numbers aside, it delivers a really gorgeous picture with bright and vibrant colors and sharp details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The downside, of course, is that there is some battery life impact. I haven&rsquo;t reviewed the 4K Dell XPS 13, so I can&rsquo;t speak to that unit&rsquo;s longevity. But compared to the FHD model I reviewed, the OLED model struggles on the battery life front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Dell XPS 13 OLED closed seen from the left side on a wooden table.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pVRKsZ46Doc9OOx2FcEDj0Ioobs=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653796/mchin_20190905_4631_0003.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Not too many ports.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Battery life, for context, has been a huge selling point of other XPS 13 models. I averaged nine hours and 15 minutes using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-touch-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop/xn9310cto230h?configurationid=7d01f270-b71e-4488-a6e9-56ab3a967927\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FHD model</a>&nbsp;as my primary work driver around 200 nits of brightness. With the OLED model, I was getting about five hours from the same workload at the same brightness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s... well, that&rsquo;s a big gap. And it should be a serious consideration if you&rsquo;re thinking of purchasing this device. After all, the FHD display is still pretty darn good. The blacks on my review unit weren&rsquo;t as deep as they were on this OLED panel, but the picture it delivered was still fantastic and not something my un-artistic eyes had any problems with. (On the other hand, the non-OLED 4K display also doesn&rsquo;t seem to have great battery life,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-2020\">per</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-model-9310-4k\">other</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-XPS-13-9300-4K-UHD-Laptop-Review-16-10-is-the-New-16-9.464337.0.html\">reviews</a>. So the OLED is more competitive with that model, especially since it&rsquo;s the same price.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Intel Evo sticker on the bottom right corner of the Dell XPS 13 OLED.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1icknw5ihYhOrKGsSShZ0yhQwEg=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653797/mchin_20190905_4631_0004.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>It&rsquo;s Evo-certified, despite the battery life.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that reason, I would still recommend that most people go for the FHD XPS 13 over the OLED model. Five hours is not great battery life, but it&rsquo;s especially not great for an ultraportable laptop this close to the $2,000 mark. It&rsquo;s certainly a dealbreaker for me, even if everything else about a laptop is perfect. It means I&rsquo;d have to have this thing plugged in multiple times a day, even though one of its primary benefits is supposed to be that it&rsquo;s light enough to carry around wherever. I want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, as nice as the OLED screen is, I can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;ll make a huge quality-of-life difference to all but the most discerning of viewers. It certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be a big enough difference to outweigh a $300 premium and a four-hour hit to battery life. If you&rsquo;re someone for whom the OLED is worth the price, you probably know who you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Dell XPS 13 OLED lid on a wooden table seen from the top.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_x3I9N44xhWVDu-UkO4mPodna4=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653798/mchin_20190905_4631_0005.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Buy it for $1,699.99.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop/xn9310cto235h\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/23DxQ-yPuwcxKNH8qgO7lM1aLEI=/0x0:1000x1000/1200x1200/filters:focal(500x500:501x501)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653794/mchin_20190905_4631_0001sq.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop/xn9310cto235h\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DELL XPS 13 OLED</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>$1,650</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>$1,900</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>14% off</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices taken at time of publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Dell XPS 13 OLED, a great laptop meets a great screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop/xn9310cto235h\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,650&nbsp;AT DELL</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photography by Monica Chin / The Verge</em></p>', 'It’s not the XPS for everyone', 'It’s not the XPS for everyone', '1623698159_mchin_20190905_4631_0001.0.webp', 1, '2021-06-14', 3),

The software maker is holding a special Windows event to reveal the &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; of the OS next week. The event starts at 11AM ET, and the event invite includes a window that creates a shadow with an outline that looks like the number 11.

Of course, it only has a 60Hz screen and Radeon integrated graphics, so it&rsquo;s far from a &ldquo;gaming laptop&rdquo; of any sort. Still, Asus has made a few design tweaks to better evoke the aesthetic. Namely, the WASD keys are outlined in orange, which Asus says &ldquo;lets users stand out while enjoying quick, intuitive gameplay in cloud-based games.&rdquo; Some Windows laptops have done bold things with their WASD keys, but this is the first Chromebook we&rsquo;ve seen with that feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asus also emphasized the Harmon Kardon-certified audio system and Wi-Fi stabilizer technology, which should likely help create a more immersive gaming experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8x7AojYAathwdpudfoG2-8PaAVQ=/0x0:1280x960/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1280x960):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657876/34_235_776_V22.jpg\" /><cite>Image: Newegg</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CM5 has a 57Wh battery, which Asus claims offers up to 10 hours of battery life. You can configure the device with up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage as well. You can choose a Ryzen 5 3500C or a Ryzen 3 3250C, both of which come with AMD Radeon integrated graphics.

The company is also reportedly planning a successor to last year&rsquo;s more affordable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features\">Apple Watch SE</a>, as well as a new extreme sports-focused model, due for release in 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The improvements coming to this year&rsquo;s model, which will almost certainly be called the Series 7, appear to be small. Its display bezels are said to be thinner, and a new lamination technique could reduce the distance between the display and the front cover. The watch&rsquo;s ultra-wideband support could also be improved after getting its Apple wearable debut in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location\">last year&rsquo;s Series 6</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>AN EXTREME SPORTS-FOCUSED MODEL MAY NOT LAUNCH UNTIL NEXT YEAR</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the years ahead could bring more substantial improvements for Apple&rsquo;s wearable. Top of the list is a new blood glucose monitoring feature, which could automatically log blood-sugar levels for diabetics without them needing to prick a finger to draw blood. There&rsquo;s also reportedly a new body temperature monitoring feature on the way, which has reportedly seen a surge in interest due to the pandemic.

It&rsquo;s unclear in how many other countries LG is offering the extended warranty, and the company did not immediately respond to&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>&rsquo;s questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The extended warranty appears to be an attempt to upsell customers from LG&rsquo;s popular lower-end sets like the C1 to its more premium G1 model. But it should also allay any fears that the new brighter Evo OLED panel LG is using in the G1 won&rsquo;t last as long as its previous OLED panels. Or, as LG said in a statement&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/lg-oled-tvs-now-come-with-a-five-year-warranty-but-not-all-of-them\">given to&nbsp;<em>TechRadar</em></a>, &ldquo;The warranty is designed to offer peace of mind to customers purchasing our flagship, more expensive OLED models.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>LG&rsquo;S CHEAPER C1 OLED IS NOT INCLUDED</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the big question is whether the extended warranty covers permanent image retention, aka &ldquo;burn-in,&rdquo; where parts of an image can remain visible after being displayed for an extended period. In response to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-extends-2021-g1-oled-warranty-five-years-175840084.html?src=rss_b2c\"><em>Engadget</em>&rsquo;s question</a>&nbsp;about this, LG gave this evasive response:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;LG&rsquo;s five-year limited warranty program is in line with the company&rsquo;s consistent communication regarding the low risk of image retention on LG OLED TVs, when used in normal viewing conditions&hellip; As with any self-emitting display, OLED TVs may experience temporary image retention under certain conditions, but permanent image retention, or burn-in, is rare under normal viewing conditions. Image retention is not a product defect.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The implication seems to be that temporary image retention is normal and is nothing to worry about, but all LG will say about permanent image retention is that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;rare.&rdquo; Meanwhile, in a statement given&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b09oXig-4wk\">to&nbsp;<em>HDTVTest</em></a>&nbsp;the company said the warranty covers &ldquo;any image issues,&rdquo; so long as the display is being used normally, and not in a commercial setting where static images might be left onscreen for far longer (the famous example of this is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-switches-airport-oled-to-lcd-amid-burn-in-row/\">South Korean airport</a>&nbsp;which had to swap out the OLED TVs it was using to show departure times). We&rsquo;ve contacted LG to try and get a simple yes or no answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like other warranties, LG&rsquo;s also comes with various exceptions, such as damage caused by power surges, acts of nature, or improper installation. But LG&rsquo;s warranty should still provide some assurance that you&rsquo;ll get a decent few years of use if you splash out on one of its more expensive TVs.</p>', 'In the UK, the 8K Z1 OLED is also covered', 'In the UK, the 8K Z1 OLED is also covered', '1623698692_large01.0.webp', 1, '2021-06-14', 3),

Rarely has a film so neatly emotionally vivisected me as this one about a villain best known for&nbsp;<em>wanting to skin puppies to make a coat</em>. Only&nbsp;<em>Cruella</em>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t about that character really. It&rsquo;s not about her war with the fur industry or PETA. It&rsquo;s definitely not about a collection of Dalmatian dogs fleeing her furrier desires. It&rsquo;s a colorful and pulpy tale of a woman with profound narcissistic tendencies getting vengeance on a murderer and becoming a London fashion icon. I&rsquo;m sorry if you ever thought, &ldquo;I could never have anything but camp-fueled affection for Disney&rsquo;s puppy killer&rdquo; because this gal is a delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is more&nbsp;<em>Wicked</em>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<em>Joker&nbsp;</em>in that it reimagines a notorious villain as a misunderstood hero besmirched by popular media. Yet I have no idea&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>it is a movie about Cruella de Vil and not simply an original film about a woman with profound narcissistic tendencies getting vengeance on a murderer and becoming a London fashion icon. Where&nbsp;<em>Wicked</em>&nbsp;(both the book and the musical) takes pains to explore how media can corrupt an image,&nbsp;<em>Cruella</em>&nbsp;largely sidesteps jibes about populism or media to just put on a big fabulous show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Emma Stone dressed as Cruella de Vil.

I&rsquo;m not saying I needed to see Emma Stone skin 101 puppies, but at least then the focus on Cruella would have made sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In every lull in the film I found myself trying to figure out why exactly&nbsp;<em>Cruella</em>&nbsp;exists, entertaining as it is. One colleague jokingly told me he thinks it was made because Disney made some digital dog tech from&nbsp;<em>Lady and the Tramp</em>&nbsp;and wanted to get the most out of it. To his credit, there are a lot of dogs running between Emma Stone&#39;s legs and leaping over her and generally being adorable in&nbsp;<em>Cruella</em>. There are even a few Dalmatians! They all look realistic and pettable until the uncanny valley occasionally catches them in its maw and you are reminded that those are some very fake dogs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And even if this film&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;greenlit as some bean counter&rsquo;s way of making back the cash spent to produce the tech for&nbsp;<em>Lady and the Tramp,</em>&nbsp;it still means that somewhere once upon a time some Disney execs were sitting in their office, legs up on the desk, tasteful Mickey Mouse-branded socks peeking out from between expensively tailored pants and more expensive shoes, and looking at this pitch, saying &ldquo;sure, let&rsquo;s reimagine the story of that villain who really has no redeemable quality apart from her taste in cars as a misunderstood antisocial heroine just out to resolve some true injustices in the world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Emma Stone as Cruella de Vil in a red gown surrounded by party goers dressed entirely in black and white.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0xRZxqouqOCTuU1f6ndlffFr_8=/0x0:4096x2730/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:4096x2730):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539293/24d414407a5cf2e6633fe7a10cc44182_4096x2730_b7af0050.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This woman was previously on fire.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Image: Disney</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At no point does the film attempt to explain &mdash; or even hint &mdash; at how Cruella would turn from a fashion icon with a very deeply buried heart of gold into a monster forcing her friends to kidnap puppies from another friend and to make a coat. It starts with Cruella, then called Estella, going to school, causing trouble, and being doted on by her exceptionally nice mother. After a murder that Cruella blames herself for, she flees into the streets of London and meets two young thieves, Jasper and Horace. She dyes her distinguishable hair and joins them in their heist and the three become a family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as much as Estella loves crime, her true passion is&nbsp;<em>fashion</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then shoot forward 10 years to an otherworldly version of &lsquo;70s London. Estella&rsquo;s adoptive brothers (Joel Fry gives Jasper heart even as Paul Walter Hauser happily plays Horace as a cartoon) get her a job at a high-end store in the hopes she&rsquo;ll wow them with her skills as a designer and seamstress. And while she enrages her bosses, she catches the eye of the Baroness (Emma Thompson), the biggest and most powerful designer in London. Estella then is torn between a desire to prove herself to the Baroness and to destroy the Baroness, and the movie quickly becomes scene after scene of guerilla fashion shows framed like the most gorgeous-looking heists you&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Emma Thompson as the Baroness.

I questioned if I was stoned as Cruella raced across London in a dump truck after charging a one-eyed Chihuahua with a jailbreak. Not because it was silly (it was!) but because it was played deadly seriously. Stone and Thompson anchor the whole affair with cartoonish characters treated with the gravitas of historical figures. They do not wink at the camera. They do not make sly referential jokes about the story material. They just go to war with flaming dresses and shimmering moth cocoons and the occasional blow of a dog whistle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You usually know when you&rsquo;re supposed to laugh and when you&rsquo;re just supposed to enjoy yourself watching a movie, but I found myself torn constantly by&nbsp;<em>Cruella</em>.

Today, director Matt Reeves debuted a first look at Pattinson&rsquo;s take on the Dark Knight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe surprising to some, it&rsquo;s a good sized teaser trailer. Production on the film shut down by the pandemic, but the footage Reeves brought to DC&rsquo;s FanDome virtual convention is a pretty good glance at what fans of the caped crusader should expect. Like always in Gotham City, crime is running rampant, and some nefarious force is trying to get to Batman. The story takes place about two years into Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s career as Batman, a period when he&rsquo;s still just a masked vigilante. Reeves stressed that Batman isn&rsquo;t Batman yet, and there are people &ldquo;who are afraid of him, quite frankly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trailer also introduces a few key characters, including Jeffrey Wright&rsquo;s James Gordon and Zoe Kravitz&rsquo;s Catwoman. Andy Serkis&rsquo; Alfred can also be heard. Reeves stressed that many of these characters are still coming into themselves; Selina Kyle is not Catwoman yet, for example. Both The Riddler and The Penguin are also early into their own criminal careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably the most shocking part of the trailer isn&rsquo;t Pattinson and Reeves&rsquo; take on Batman but on Bruce Wayne. This doesn&rsquo;t look like the well-kept, put together playboy version of Bruce Wayne that fans of Christian Bale, Michael Keaton, and even Ben Affleck&rsquo;s portrayals may expect. Pattinson&rsquo;s Bruce Wayne is a little more unkempt, a little more goth; consider me intrigued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Without being an origin story for him, it&rsquo;s something that touches upon his origins,&rdquo; Reeves said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reeves has shared a few details over the last few months, including a previous first look at Pattinson&rsquo;s Batman costume and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164886/batmobile-batman-matt-reeves-robert-pattinson-motorcycle-suit\">images of the new Batmobile</a>. The film was originally supposed to be released on June 21st, 2021, but because of the pandemic affecting production and other film&rsquo;s releases this year,&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>was pushed to October 1st, 2021. The delay sucks for any Batman fan, but based on the imagery we&rsquo;ve seen so far, being released during the month of Halloween seems pretty perfect.</p>', 'Gotham’s Dark Knight looks much different this time', 'Gotham’s Dark Knight looks much different this time', '1623699324_Screen_Shot_2020_08_22_at_8.57.22_PM.jpg', 1, '2021-06-14', 3),

An intriguing email chain has surfaced during&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business\">the&nbsp;<em>Epic v.

Apple&rsquo;s Matt Fischer (VP of the App Store) clearly objects to the idea at first. &ldquo;[W]ho green lit putting the Files app above Dropbox in organic search results? I didn&rsquo;t know we did that, and I don&rsquo;t think we should,&rdquo; he says.

While Apple didn&rsquo;t challenge the idea that Files was unfairly ranked over Dropbox, the company says the reality was a simple mistake: the Files app had a Dropbox integration, so Apple put &ldquo;Dropbox&rdquo; into the app&rsquo;s metadata, and it was automatically ranked higher for &ldquo;Dropbox&rdquo; searches as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" id=\"twitter-widget-0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3R3ZWV0X2VtYmVkX2NsaWNrYWJpbGl0eV8xMjEwMiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250cm9sIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH19&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1401905981085343749&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F11%2F22528701%2Fapple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017&amp;sessionId=44b8e24c1cbdfe2907ece4aafd2b7107f5cb459b&amp;siteScreenName=verge&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&amp;width=550px\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m slightly skeptical of that explanation &mdash; partially because it doesn&rsquo;t line up with what Naskar suggests in the email, partially because Apple&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;told me it immediately fixed the error (despite it apparently continuing to exist for 11 months, hardly immediate), and partially because the company repeatedly ignored my questions about whether this has ever happened with other apps before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most Apple would tell me is that it didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>manually</em>&nbsp;boost Files over competitors, and that &ldquo;we do not advantage our apps over those of any developer or competitor&rdquo; as a general rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>BEST CASE, APPLE DIDN&rsquo;T NOTICE IT WAS GIVING ITSELF AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE UNTIL ANOTHER CEO POINTED IT OUT</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But honestly, it may not matter whether Apple&nbsp;<em>manually</em>&nbsp;boosted its own apps or not. What matters is the result: for 11 months, Apple&rsquo;s new Files app owned exact searches for its competitor Dropbox, a company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-once-vowed-to-kill-dropbox-now-its-worth-2013-11\">Steve Jobs reportedly swore he would kill off</a>, and it took the CEO of a prominent Apple partner emailing the company before Apple did something about it. And based on&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>&rsquo;s investigation, Apple may not have done much: the Files app still ranked #1 in the App Store for cloud storage in June 2018, a month after this email chain was resolved, according to an infographic that accompanied&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221?shareToken=st44e68b42ce5f45f5bd573dae5f8f0f5c\">the&nbsp;<em>WSJ</em>&nbsp;story</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, the distinction between a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; boost and any other kind of boost may be purely academic. Algorithms are written by people, after all. If Apple can build a 42-factor algorithm that gives its own apps favorable results, why would it need to override that algorithm and risk its emails getting caught up in a lawsuit years from now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could just tweak that algorithm at will &mdash; which is exactly what it did to resolve the&nbsp;<em>WSJ</em>&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;NYT</em>&rsquo;s scrutiny two years ago. It only took a single engineer to change the algorithm in July 2019,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html\">according to the&nbsp;<em>Times</em></a>, and Apple&rsquo;s own apps immediately fell in App Store rankings. But that time, executives said the previous formula wasn&rsquo;t a mistake. Apple simply wanted to make it look less like its own apps were getting special treatment. So it &ldquo;improved&rdquo; the algorithm to achieve the new result it wanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple provided this statement:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. App Store Search has only one goal &mdash; to get customers what they are looking for. We do that in a way that is fair to all developers and we do not advantage our apps over those of any developer or competitor. Today, developers have many options for distributing their apps and that&rsquo;s why we work hard to make it easy, fair and a great opportunity for them to develop apps for our customers around the world.</p>\r\n</blockquote>', '“We are removing the manual boost and the search results should be more relevant now”', '“We are removing the manual boost and the search results should be more relevant now”', '1623700532_apple_app_store_wwdc_2021.0.webp', 1, '2021-06-14', 3),

Onstage, the company announced Apple TV Channels, which will let customers pay for HBO, Showtime, Starz, CBS All Access, and other services directly through the TV app and watch everything there, too. Apple will be handling the streams and promises top-tier picture and audio quality for all Apple TV Channels it offers. A redesigned TV app is coming in May, and Apple says it will make finding the latest must-watch shows easier and surface recommendations from over 150 third-party video apps that Apple will offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8a8HBO0eQrxFoj5xEeIU-ImMRrM=/0x0:816x500/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:816x500):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15985883/TVapp.jpg\" /><cite>Image: Apple</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We designed a new TV experience where you can pay for only the channels you want, all in one app, with the password you already have,&rdquo; said Apple&rsquo;s Peter Stern. &ldquo;Watch everything on demand and ad-free.

The Apple TV app has been entirely redesigned to let you watch everything in one place, whereas the old one would switch you over to third-party apps when it actually came time to watch something. &ldquo;No more bouncing around from app to app,&rdquo; Stern said. There are some exceptions to that, however: Netflix isn&rsquo;t backing the new TV app, and so it doesn&rsquo;t offer this integration.

Convenience is really the name of the game, and putting everything in one place is much simpler for people who are trying to track what they&rsquo;re spending on these services. Apple&rsquo;s execution is a bit different since it doesn&rsquo;t require a major service like Prime as a prerequisite before consumers can buy subscriptions. So the barrier of entry is lower.

The company revolutionized digital music with the iPod and iTunes, but is now playing catch up, trying to align itself with the current era of subscription offerings. &quot;We&rsquo;ve had a long relationship with music,&quot; said Apple CEO Tim Cook. &quot;And music has had a rich history of change, some of which we&rsquo;ve played a part in.&quot; The service will bring combine music downloads, streaming radio, and a streaming music service into a single app. Like most digital services, it promises to learn your tastes and recommend great new songs accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>$14.99 A MONTH FOR SIX FAMILY MEMBERS</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service will cost $9.99 a month, or $14.99 for a family plan of up to six individuals, with a three-month free trial. In order to use the family plan, you&#39;ll need to have iCloud Family Sharing active. By contrast, Spotify offers a two-person subscription package for $14.99. Apple says its new music service will be available June 30th, with Android coming in the fall. Apple had hoped to shake things up by offering a tier priced between $5 and $8, but unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t get the music industry on board. The end result is a product that has little to differentiate it from what is already in the market in terms of price and selection. The 30 million tracks on Apple Music are also going to be found on Spotify or Rdio. Apple is hoping features and exclusive content will be enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>JIMMY IOVINE HAS BEEN LEADING APPLE&#39;S PUSH INTO STREAMING</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paid Apple Music users will be able to download albums and playlists to play offline, while free users will only be able to listen to Apple Music radio stations with limited skipping.&nbsp;The company has rebuilt iTunes Radio and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://%20http//www.theverge.com/2015/5/31/8694585/drake-david-guetta-pharrell-itunes-radio-guest-DJ\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly staffed</a>&nbsp;it with big-name artists like Dr. Dre, will.i.am, Pharrell, and Drake acting as DJs. It is also bringing on experienced talent like BBC&rsquo;s Zane Lowe to help curate stations. Jimmy Iovine, who has been heading up Apple&rsquo;s renewed push into music, reportedly tried to sign other big names like Kanye West and Beyonc&eacute; to exclusive deals, but lost out to Tidal, a rival service recently launched by Jay Z and a consortium of high-profile musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first station is called BeatsOne and will be available in 100 countries. It&#39;s going to be playing tunes around the clock and will be anchored by three DJs: Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden, and Julie Adenuga. Subscribers can skip as many tracks as they like. Apple&#39;s Eddie Cue says that the music it recommends to you &quot;isn&#39;t just algorithms, it&#39;s recommendations made by our team of experts.&quot; This is pretty much the same pitch that Beats made when it launched. Users who signed up for that service will find their accounts transferred automatically to Apple Music when the latter launches on June 30th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"apple music screenshots\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YMqjiHtjk8uYw0xIy4ahtF8WyEU=/0x0:2400x1589/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2400x1589):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3771302/apple_music_screenshots.0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple also showed off a feature called Connect that lets artists upload music, photos, and messages which are shared with their fans. It&#39;s basically a blog fans can subscribe to, then comment and like individual posts. This is similar to the exclusive behind-the-scenes material that Tidal has been sharing from its cadre of artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>DRAKE IS RELEASING HIS NEXT ALBUM ON CONNECT</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drake came onstage to show off Connect. He said as a child he wondered if he or anyone from Canada could make it big in the world of rap. Luckily technology was there to help. &quot;The dream of being a new artist like myself five years ago and connecting directly with an audience has never been more close or reachable.&quot; He will be&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8747901/wwdc2015-apple-music-connect-drake-new-album\" target=\"_blank\">releasing his next album</a>, obviously, on Connect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some cool Siri integration. You can ask it to play a particular artist or track. You can also give it a more general query, like &quot;play the top track from the summer of 1982,&quot; or whatever year you happened to have graduated from high school. But Apple says you don&#39;t need your iPhone present &mdash; you&#39;ll be able to sync songs to your Apple Watch without it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>SIRI, PLAY ME THE MOST RETWEETED TRACK OF 2014</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big question is whether Apple needs to differentiate to succeed. It is entering a market dominated by Spotify, which has racked up over 60 million users, with 15 million paid subscribers. Spotify has had the run of the land since it came to the US from Europe in 2011, but with over 800 million credit cards on file, Apple has a chance to quickly assemble a large user base and give Spotify its first true challenger. If it can get people who purchase a new Apple device to sign up for a free trial, it may end up bringing a large number of new users into the streaming music market that up until this point were not convinced to give a paid service a try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"mary meeker music slide cropped\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwPfQrCsrHZAN27kud0JMm02ong=/0x0:560x394/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:560x394):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/4527909/cd.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/partner/mary-meeker\"><em>Mary Meeker</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Apple is arriving late to the music streaming business, due in part to Steve Jobs&#39; refusal to believe that music subscription services would ever work,&quot; says Forrester analyst James McQuivey. &quot;But the writing is on the wall: digital downloads don&#39;t make sense for consumers that are connected wherever they go.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pitch repeated during the event was about simplicity and unity. &quot;Apple Music is really going to move the needle for fans and artists,&quot; said Jimmy Iovine, the record executive and founder of Beats who is now helping to lead Apple&#39;s charge into music. &quot;Online music has become a complicated mess of apps, services, and websites.

We&rsquo;ll be covering the whole event live at&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>, but here&rsquo;s a rundown of what we expect to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kinf_f2HWmuLplRW7Yhh2JkRxog=/0x0:1920x1280/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1280):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22671569/windows11main.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Part of the new Windows 11 UI.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>NEW WINDOWS 11 UI</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve known for months that Microsoft has been working on UI improvements to Windows, and it looks like most of them will appear in Windows 11.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu\">A leaked version of the operating system</a>&nbsp;includes an updated design, with a new Start menu that now appears centered on the taskbar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKekmqxCChUXYwJs70xMTU7h5aE=/0x0:2736x1824/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2736x1824):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22671564/Screenshot__2_.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The new Windows inking in Windows 11.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qBlJKt_HnL_FRYa0yWhHqnkWUM=/0x0:2736x1824/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2736x1824):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22671565/Screenshot__4_.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Windows Widgets in Windows 11.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s very similar to what we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on\">seen in Windows 10X</a>, which Microsoft canceled in favor of bringing parts of that OS to the main version of Windows. The 10X version of Windows was originally built for dual-screen devices, but Microsoft has now put that work on hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Start menu in Windows 11 acts as more of a launcher in the leaked copy, allowing you to find recently used documents or favorite apps quickly. The Live Tiles that originally appeared in Windows 8 are now gone, but you can still move the Start menu to the left-hand side of the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other subtle UI improvements beyond just the Start menu and button. We&rsquo;re expecting to see a big focus on rounded corners with Windows 11 and new improvements to multitasking across tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs. The leaked copy doesn&rsquo;t have every UI change, and we&rsquo;re expecting additional changes to the taskbar, notification center, and general parts of Windows like the volume pop-up and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A NEW WINDOWS STORE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We also anticipate Microsoft will spend time talking about its new store approach in Windows 11. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella teased &ldquo;significant updates&rdquo; for Windows that will focus on the economic opportunity for developers and creators. &ldquo;We will create more opportunity for every Windows developer today and welcome every creator who is looking for the most innovative, new, open platform to build and distribute and monetize applications,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote\">said Nadella last month</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpsYYBKk6a6rJwmR01LWdzoy4CU=/0x0:1434x919/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1434x919):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22671500/fPGvJl2.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Windows store needs an overhaul.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor\">reportedly been working on a new Windows store</a>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s open to all apps and games. The overhaul could pave the way for developers to submit any Windows application to the store, including browsers like Chrome or Firefox, and even allow third-party commerce platforms in apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enabling third-party commerce platforms across apps found in the Windows store would allow developers to bypass the 15 percent cut that Microsoft takes from developers who use in-app payments. That would be a significant change, during a time when Microsoft, Epic Games, and others are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news\">piling on the pressure</a>&nbsp;for Apple to make changes to its App Store policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent\">recently announced a reduction</a>&nbsp;to the 30 percent cut it takes from PC games on the Windows store, too. This has dropped to just 12 percent, below the 15 percent cut it takes on apps. It matches what Epic Games offers in its own store, and the move will likely put more pressure on Valve&rsquo;s Steam store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Microsoft Surface Laptop\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KPmU6i7UdszHKtgWSW4ga1Ikv4=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8451737/akrales_170502_1637_0519.0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Expect to see productivity and multitasking improvements in Windows 11.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A FOCUS ON THOSE WHO RELY ON WINDOWS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While Microsoft has tried to entice creators, developers, and others to Windows in the past, we&rsquo;re expecting the company to focus on core improvements in Windows 11 that will benefit those who rely on the operating system daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft was surprised to see Windows usage explode during the pandemic, and it feels like Windows 11 is the chance to prove the company has invested more in the overall health of its decades-old operating system. We&rsquo;re hoping to see a bigger focus on productivity and even some power user features, alongside the usual improvements to security that Microsoft typically delivers with new Windows versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve seen hints at improving the multitasking interface across desktop PCs and even tablets in the leaked version of Windows 11, with a new UI that lets you easily snap apps. Microsoft is also improving how it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12\">handles multiple monitor support in Windows 11</a>, bringing an end to the frustrations that power users have experienced for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also an opportunity for Microsoft to focus more on gaming with Windows 11. It&rsquo;s been a big area of focus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud\">on the Xbox side recently</a>, and Microsoft admitted years ago that it has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/11/18084172/microsoft-store-pc-gaming-xbox-phil-spencer-comments\">a lot of work to do on Windows PC gaming</a>. Some of that has already started with a new Xbox app we expect to see bundled in Windows 11, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18635709/microsoft-xbox-game-bar-windows-10-release\">impressive Xbox Game Bar</a>. But there are some underlying changes Microsoft can make to Windows to improve PC gaming and performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re expecting to hear more about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12\">Auto HDR feature from Xbox</a>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s coming to Windows, alongside improvements like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-is-coming-to-pc/\">DirectStorage</a>&nbsp;that will speed up game load times. We&rsquo;d also love to see some improvements around game security, to prevent aimbots and wallhacks in games, but we&rsquo;re not expecting Windows 11 to solve this complicated problem alone. Microsoft does have a chance to prove it&rsquo;s more committed to PC gaming with Windows 11, particularly as it&rsquo;s the platform of choice for PC gamers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A FREE UPGRADE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re expecting Windows 11 to be a free upgrade for any PC running Windows 10 right now. Microsoft focused heavily on free upgrades to Windows 10 during its launch period, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to suddenly start charging for Windows 11. Microsoft makes most of its Windows revenue through OEM or commercial licenses, so a free upgrade to Windows 11 for consumers seems like a no-brainer.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em>Stay tuned to&nbsp;</em>The Verge<em>&nbsp;on June 24th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT.

Absent is the iPhone Mini with its 5.7-inch screen. Analysts, including Kuo, have said that the Mini will be going away in 2022 due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease\">reportedly low sales</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some may mourn the loss of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus\">an actually small phone option</a>, from Apple&rsquo;s perspective, going big with its line of mainstream phones makes sense.

The report showed both that many customers were buying phones that had screens larger than six inches and that more people were turning to Samsung than Apple for their big phone needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_e9lM2UKj4jubxR33fYmYqG_eSE=/0x0:2233x656/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2233x656):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678069/apple_charts.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; Charts from the report showing the screen size breakdown for phones sold and average price points.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both companies face&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak\">a market that is slowing down</a>, and one that is having to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18263584/why-phones-are-so-expensive-price-apple-samsung-google\">grapple with rising costs</a>. If Apple has made the decision to make a lower-end big phone, it&rsquo;s done so after seeing the research that many consumers want phones that are both bigger, and cheaper. While Apple has somewhat been working toward that goal (the iPhone 12, 11, and XR have all had 6.1-inch screens), it&rsquo;s generally kept the really big phones at the high-end &mdash; next year could be its time to court users who want something bigger than 6.1-inches, but don&rsquo;t want to spend over $1,000 to get it.</p>', 'Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the company is targeting a price under $900', 'Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the company is targeting a price under $900', '1624512198_Screen_Shot_2021_06_23_at_3.53.24_PM.0.webp', 1, '2021-06-24', 3),
